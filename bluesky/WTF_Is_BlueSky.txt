This directory is intended as a testing ground of new vcf tech, without comitting it to the main VCF source tree. It's not meant to be used other than as a developer sandbox, so consider yourself warned. If code here turns your computer into a molten slag heap of plastic and silicon, it's not our fault! Of course, gdb can easily provide the same results, so go figure...
