*Revision 1.7.26.1  2003/10/23 04:24:51  ddiego
*more musical chairs with headers again, in yet another attempt to make
*them more efficent to speed up compiles.
*Removed all teh template RTTI classes and put them all in one header
*called VCFRTTIImpl.h. This should help compile speeds a bit.
*The next step is to look at some of the event classes and remove ones
*that aren't really neccessary - I'd estimate that 50% of the current
*event classes are unneccessary and can be removed.
*
*Revision 1.7  2002/01/24 01:46:48  ddiego
*added a cvs "log" comment to the top of all files in vcf/src and vcf/include
*to facilitate change tracking
