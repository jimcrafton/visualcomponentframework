*more musical chairs with headers again, in yet another attempt to make
*them more efficent to speed up compiles.
*Removed all teh template RTTI classes and put them all in one header
*called VCFRTTIImpl.h. This should help compile speeds a bit.
*The next step is to look at some of the event classes and remove ones
*that aren't really neccessary - I'd estimate that 50% of the current
*event classes are unneccessary and can be removed.
