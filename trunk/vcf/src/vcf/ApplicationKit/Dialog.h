/**
\par
A Dialog is a popup frame that is generally used for user input. 

\par
A Dialog has a special state variable that tells what the "mode"
of the dialog is. This mode is determined not by how the dialog is 
\em created but rather by how the dialog is displayed which is 
done by calling either Dialog:show(), Dialog::showModal(), or 
Dialog::showSheetModal(). Each of these sets the dialog's modal
state to either modeless, modal, or sheet modal. A modeless dialog 
is visible till the user closes the dialog, but it doesn't prevent
the use from changing focus back to the orginal window that launched
the dialog. A modal, or application modal, dialog, disables everything
else, and enters into a modal event loop that does not end till the
dialog is closed. Nothing else can be accomplished in the UI till the 
dialog is closed. A sheet modal dialog is used to attach a dialog to 
a specific window, and while the dialog is visible the window that launched
(also known as the \em owner window) the dialog is disabled, but all other 
UI activity can still take place. When the sheet modal dialog is closed the
owner window is enabled again for UI input. 

\par
Think of a sheet modal dialog
as a middle ground between modeless and application modal.

\par
A dialog's UI is normally a frame with a close button, and optionally a help and system 
button as well. The caption is the standard height.
