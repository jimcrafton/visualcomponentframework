*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.4  2006/04/07 02:35:22  ddiego
*initial checkin of merge from 0.6.9 dev branch.
*
*Revision 1.3.4.1  2006/03/14 02:25:46  ddiego
*large amounts of source docs updated.
*
*Revision 1.3  2004/12/01 04:31:21  ddiego
*merged over devmain-0-6-6 code. Marcello did a kick ass job
*of fixing a nasty bug (1074768VCF application slows down modal dialogs.)
*that he found. Many, many thanks for this Marcello.
*
*Revision 1.2.2.1  2004/09/21 23:41:23  ddiego
*made some big changes to how the base list, tree, text, table, and tab models are laid out. They are not just plain interfaces. The actual
*concrete implementations of them now derive from BOTH Model and the specific
*tree, table, etc model interface.
*Also made some fixes to the way the text input is handled for a text control.
*We now process on a character by character basis and modify the model one
*character at a time. Previously we were just using brute force and setting
*the whole models text. This is more efficent, though its also more complex.
*
*Revision 1.2  2004/08/07 02:49:07  ddiego
*merged in the devmain-0-6-5 branch to stable
*
*Revision 1.1.2.3  2004/06/06 07:05:30  marcelloptr

*
*Revision 1.9  2003/12/18 05:15:57  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.8.6.1  2003/09/12 00:09:32  ddiego
*added better tabbing behaviour - fixed an earlier bug.
*Code is easier to understand and it simplified the implementation
*a bit as well
*Moved around the RTTI definitions for various Appkit classes to a
*single inline and stripped them from the various class headers
*
*Revision 1.8  2003/02/26 04:30:37  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.
*most additions are in the area of the current linux port, but the major
*addition to this release is the addition of a Condition class (currently
*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.7.14.1  2002/12/25 22:37:59  ddiego
*more stupid fixes to get rid of the damn gcc no newline warning...grrr...
*
*Revision 1.7  2002/05/09 03:10:42  ddiego

*to facilitate change tracking
