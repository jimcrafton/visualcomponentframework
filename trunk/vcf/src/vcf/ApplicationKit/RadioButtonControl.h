*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.2  2004/08/07 02:49:09  ddiego
*merged in the devmain-0-6-5 branch to stable
*
*Revision 1.1.2.4  2004/06/18 17:45:04  ddiego
*fixed bug in radio button control in implementation of setChecked().
*
*Revision 1.1.2.3  2004/06/06 07:05:30  marcelloptr
*changed macros, text reformatting, copyright sections
*
*Revision 1.1.2.2  2004/04/29 03:43:14  marcelloptr
*reformatting of source files: macros and csvlog and copyright sections
*
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/28 00:28:19  ddiego
*migration towards new directory structure

*
*Revision 1.12  2003/12/18 05:15:57  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.11.4.3  2003/09/12 00:09:32  ddiego
*added better tabbing behaviour - fixed an earlier bug.
*Code is easier to understand and it simplified the implementation
*a bit as well
*Moved around the RTTI definitions for various Appkit classes to a
*single inline and stripped them from the various class headers
*
*Revision 1.11.4.2  2003/09/06 19:45:45  ddiego
*changes to ensure that the destroy() is properly called.
*Destructors were moved back to pbulic scope in case that was causing a bug.
*Moving them all(all teh component derived classes) to private scope causes
*a complete failure in hte VC6 compiler. Alas...
*So destructors are present, and modal dialogs can still be created on the
*stack, but almost any other component should be created on the heap, and
*gotten rid of via free() NOT using operator delete directly.
*also moved the vcs info to the end of the file for some of the headers
*This will be an ongoing process.
*
*Revision 1.11.4.1  2003/09/05 21:03:39  ddiego
*moved the various control destructor's to protected scope
*migrated code into destroy() overridden methods

*switched all member variable that used the "m_"<name> prefix to
* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.10  2003/02/26 04:30:38  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.
*most additions are in the area of the current linux port, but the major
*addition to this release is the addition of a Condition class (currently
*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.9.14.1  2002/12/25 22:38:00  ddiego
*more stupid fixes to get rid of the damn gcc no newline warning...grrr...
