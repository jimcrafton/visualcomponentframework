*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.5  2006/04/07 02:35:22  ddiego
*initial checkin of merge from 0.6.9 dev branch.
*
*Revision 1.4.2.2  2006/03/14 02:25:46  ddiego
*large amounts of source docs updated.
*
*Revision 1.4.2.1  2006/03/05 02:28:04  ddiego
*updated the Item interface and adjusted the other classes accordingly.
*
*Revision 1.4  2005/07/09 23:14:52  ddiego
*merging in changes from devmain-0-6-7 branch.
*
*Revision 1.3.2.1  2005/03/20 04:29:21  ddiego
*added ability to set image lists for list box control.
*
*Revision 1.3  2004/12/01 04:31:21  ddiego
*merged over devmain-0-6-6 code. Marcello did a kick ass job
*of fixing a nasty bug (1074768VCF application slows down modal dialogs.)

*
*Revision 1.2.2.2  2004/09/21 23:41:23  ddiego
*made some big changes to how the base list, tree, text, table, and tab models are laid out. They are not just plain interfaces. The actual
*concrete implementations of them now derive from BOTH Model and the specific
*tree, table, etc model interface.
*Also made some fixes to the way the text input is handled for a text control.
*We now process on a character by character basis and modify the model one
*character at a time. Previously we were just using brute force and setting
*the whole models text. This is more efficent, though its also more complex.
