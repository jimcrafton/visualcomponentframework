*merged in the devmain-0-6-5 branch to stable
*
*Revision 1.1.2.3  2004/08/01 18:52:27  kiklop74
*A bit ugly workaround around BCB5 bugs during compilation
*
*Revision 1.1.2.2  2004/04/29 04:10:26  marcelloptr
*reformatting of source files: macros and csvlog and copyright sections
*
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/28 03:40:30  ddiego
*migration towards new directory structure
*
*Revision 1.20  2003/08/09 02:56:45  ddiego
*merge over from the devmain-0-6-1 branch
*Changes
*Features:
*-Added additional implementation to better support the MVC architecture in
*the VCF
*
*-Added a Document/View architecure that is similar to MFC's or NextSteps's
*Doc/View architectures
*
*-Integrated the Anti Grain Graphics library into the GraphicsKit. There is
*now basic support for it in terms of drawing vector shapes
*(fills and strokes). Image support will come in the next release
*
*-Added several documented graphics tutorials
*
*Bugfixes:
*
*[ 775744 ] wrong buttons on a dialog
*[ 585239 ] Painting weirdness in a modal dialog ?
*[ 585238 ] Modal dialog which makes a modal Dialog

*[ 524878 ] onDropped not called for MLTcontrol
*
*Plus an issue with some focus and getting the right popup window to activate
*has also been fixed
*
*Revision 1.19.2.1  2003/06/16 03:09:39  ddiego
*beginning to add support for AGG into the VCF GraphicsKit
*added some missing files
*added some changes to the new version of xmake
*
*Revision 1.19  2003/05/17 20:37:19  ddiego
*this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from
*the devmain-0-6-0 branch plus a few minor bug fixes
*
*Revision 1.18.2.3  2003/04/07 03:39:31  ddiego
*did some documentation work, and got everything to compile cleanly with some
*of the new additions, particularly the chnages inteh Image/ImageBits classes.
*
*Revision 1.18.2.2  2003/03/23 03:23:55  marcelloptr
*3 empty lines at the end of the files
*
*Revision 1.18.2.1  2003/03/12 03:11:58  ddiego
*switched all member variable that used the "m_"<name> prefix to
* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.18  2003/02/26 04:30:45  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.
*most additions are in the area of the current linux port, but the major
*addition to this release is the addition of a Condition class (currently
*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.17.8.1  2003/02/24 05:42:18  ddiego
*moved the code for the VariantData calss into it's own header
*migrated to the new event style using Delegates instead of relying on
*the ugly macros that we were using before - same functionality though
*made sure everything still works and compiles, including neccessary
*changes in the VCF Builder so that it creates code in the new style
*This changes to teh new style of using Delegates completes task 58837
*
*Revision 1.17  2002/09/12 03:26:05  ddiego
*merged over the changes from the devmain-0-5-5b branch
*
*Revision 1.16.6.1  2002/08/06 02:57:36  ddiego
*added base X11 files for GraphicsKit and made sure that the GraphicsKit compiles
*under linux (GCC). There is now a new dir under build/xmake called GraphicsKit
*where the xmake build script lives. This checkin also includes the base X11
*include (as part of GraphicsKitPrivate.h), as well as linking to the X11 libs
*
*Revision 1.16  2002/05/09 03:10:44  ddiego
*merged over code from development branch devmain-0-5-1a into the main CVS trunk
*
*Revision 1.15.4.1  2002/04/03 19:37:17  zzack
