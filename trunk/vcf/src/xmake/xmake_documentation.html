<h1><code>xmake</code> Documentation</h1>

<h1>xmake</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>So why another build tool ? Well that's a great question now isn't it

        ! Basically I hate make files, and the whole make file syntax. I find it

        incredibly difficult to read, it is error prone to edit, and just seems

        to me to be incredibly messy. Obviously I am not alone in this feeling,

        since there are a number of projects out there to create alternatives to

        make (Ant for Java, and Jam, come to mind immediately).</p>

        <p>So, since the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcf"> VCF</a> is now building on linux/Unix systems (so far the

        FoundationKit has been built on linux and Solaris ), it was thought it

        sure would be nice to have a single build file that could be used on any

        system for GCC, VC++, etc. Since XML syntax is easy to read (compared to

        a traditional make file), and the scope of the program would be fairly

        limited, i.e. it is designed to compiled and link C++ programs, and not

        a whole lot more, I thought it was worth the effort to try and write a

        make like program that would accept this new syntax. As it turned out it

        wasn't very hard, and maybe a couple of days of programming time (plus
        probably a week of testing) has

        gone into writing <code> xmake</code> so I think it is worth it .&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Another reason to write <code> xmake</code> was the desire to be able to have other

        developers quickly be able to build the framework, even on system that

        do not have good IDE's. I felt that it is a LOT easier to explain a

        simple set of XML tags to developers with a background in VC++ and GUI

        IDE's than trying to struggle to explain makefiles.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>While there are a couple of features that are not yet finished,
        notably the preBuild/postBuild tags, and the project level dependencies,
        the core of xmake works quite well and I have been regularly using it to
        build the VCF on linux as I work on porting it. This includes the build
        the FoundationKit as a shared library and the various test projects used
        to test the various parts of the port.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In addition to a command line tool, the <code> xmake</code> engine will become the underlying build tool

        for the VCFBuilder, so VCFBuilder workspaces/projects will share the

        same XML syntax as <code> xmake</code> does (though the VCFBuilder will include a

        number of extra tags that will simply be ignored by the <code> xmake</code> engine).&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Basic Usage</h3>

        <p><code>xmake</code> is designed to work on one or more projects. A project

        generally results in the output of a single binary, such as an

        executable (.exe) or a library (.lib) or a dynamic library (.dll or .so

        depending on your system). Within in a project, you can specify one or

        more configurations to build. For example, you could have a project

        build a &quot;Debug GCC&quot; and a &quot;Debug VC++&quot; and a

        &quot;Debug BCC&quot; (please note you can call the configuration

        anything you want), that would build a binary file using different

        compilers and linkers depending on the configuration. Configurations

        hold most of the key settings for the compiler and linker, as well as

        allowing you to specify additional build tools for specials file types

        (such as a resource compiler for .RC files on Win32 systems).&nbsp; Thus

        when using <code> xmake</code> you tell it to build a specific configuration for a

        given project in a make file (usually makefile.xml). <code> xmake</code> is smart

        enough to automatically check file dependencies for you, so if you have

        recently modified a header that two of the five source files in your

        project depend on, it will only build the two affected source files.</p>

        <p>Projects also hold a list of one or more source files that are

        necessary to build the project. These source files hold information such

        as the file name (the exact path is determined dynamically, relative to

        the path where is <code> xmake</code> is invoked), the output name, whether or not the

        file should be built (this can be useful, to allow you to turn

        &quot;off&quot; certain files ), and finally the configuration the

        source belongs to. Source files may belong to one or more

        configurations, with each configuration name separated by a

        &quot;|&quot; character (for example, <code>&quot;Debug GCC|Debug

        VC++&quot;</code>) .</p>

        <p>The command line usage is :</p>

        <p><code>xmake [projectName] -config configurationName [-f makefileName]
        || [-install] || [-clean]</code></p>

        <p>You can invoke the <code> xmake</code> program from the command line. You control

        the program by the following options :</p>

        <ul>

          <li><code>projectName</code> - is the name of the project to build in this
            makefile. If left blank then the first project found is the one that is
            built.

          <li><code>-config configurationName</code> - this tells the <code> xmake</code> program which

            configuration to build. The <code> -config</code> option <b><i>must</i></b>
            be followed by a

            configuration name so <code> xmake</code> knows what to build. Specify the wrong

            name and you will not build what you expected.

          <li><code>-f makefileName</code> -        the makefile to use. If this is not specified then
            <code>xmake</code> looks for a file named
            &quot;makefile.xml&quot; in the current directory. If this is not found then an
            error results and <code> xmake</code> exits.

          <li><code>-install</code> - currently unimplemented

          <li><code>-clean</code> - removes all binary files produced by the

            make file for the specified configuration</li>

        </ul>

        <p>An example of it's usage, for example to build the FoundationKit for
        the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcf"> VCF</a> in linux using GCC, is this:</p>
        <pre>xmake -config&nbsp; &quot;GCC Debug&quot;        </pre>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>XML syntax</h3>

      <p>Since the <code> xmake</code> makefile is based on XML it follows all XML syntax

      rules. Please note that if you need to have double quotes in a value,

      use the single quote, which will then be replaced with a double quote

      during the build process.&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;make&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>This is the outermost tag. Every <code> xmake</code> makefile must begin and end

        with this tag.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;substitutions&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>This is where you can specify variable names that will be substituted

        when the make file is parsed and executed by <code>xmake</code>. For example you can

        specify a common include path, or a common output folder. Inside of a <code>substitutions</code>

        tag you can have zero or more variable tags that have 2 attributes, a

        name and a value. The name attribute is the name of the variable as it

        will be referenced throughout the make file, and the value attribute

        specifies the string that will be substituted wherever the parser

        encounters the variable. System environment variables may also be used,

        so if you have defined <code><b>VCF_INCLUDE</b></code> as one of your

        system's environment variables, then the parser is smart enough to

        attempt to try and check to see if the variable exists.</p>

        <p>To reference the variable you do so as follows:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>$(&lt;variable name&gt;), for example if you have defined a

            variable called MyIncludePath, then you would reference it $(MyIncludePath)

          <li>%&lt;variable name&gt;%, for example if you have defined a

            variable called MyIncludePath, then you would reference it %MyIncludePath%</li>

        </ul>

        <p>An example of this tag section looks like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;substitutions&gt;

	&lt;variable name=&quot;VCF_INCLUDE&quot; value=&quot;e:\code\vcf\include&quot;/&gt;

	&lt;variable name=&quot;INC&quot; value=&quot;../../../include&quot;/&gt;

	&lt;variable name=&quot;SRC&quot; value=&quot;../../../src&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/substitutions&gt;</pre>

        <p><b><i>Please note</i></b>: Variables can be used anywhere you are
        specifying a value for a attribute.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;project&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>The project holds all the important nodes. It also has a series of

        attributes, as follows:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><code>name</code> - the name of the project. This is required.

          <li><code>path</code> - the path of the project. This is optional

            right now and doesn't do much...</li>

          <li><code>outputAs</code> - the output path of the project. This is

            used to determine the binary that represents a successful build of

            the project, and is used when your &quot;clean&quot; your project to

            specify the binary to get rid of. For example it could be &quot;FooBar.exe&quot;,

            or &quot;MyLib.dll&quot;, or &quot;MySharedCode.so&quot;.&nbsp;</li>

          <li><code>externalFileName</code> - this specifies an external xmake
            makefile to build and will cause a new xmake process to be started.
            If this is used then no other attributes are necessary (other than
            the name attribute). a relative or absolute path may be used to
            specify the makefile. All relevant arguments passed to the currently
            executing xmake process are passed to the new xmake process that
            will get started as a result. So if you called xmake like so:<br>
            <code>xmake -config &quot;GCC Debug&quot; -v -clean</code><br>
            then the new process that gets started will also use the &quot;<code>-config
            &quot;GCC Debug&quot; -v -clean&quot;</code> arguments.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Note that the <code>outputAs</code> attribute is optional. With most

        compilers/linkers you can specify where the binary output will go.

        However, as mentioned above, the output name is used so that <code> xmake</code> can

        do a complete &quot;clean&quot; of the project.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;dependencies&gt;</code></h4>

<p>The dependencies sections allows you indicate, at the project level, what
other projects need to be built first before the project that we are currently specifying.
The &lt;dependencies&gt; tag has 0 or more &lt;dependency&gt; sub tags. If your
project has no dependencies at all, then you can omit the &lt;dependencies&gt;
all together.</p>

<h4><code>&lt;dependency&gt;</code></h4>

<p>This tag indicates a particular project that must be built prior to building
the parent project that is a part of. A dependency has the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>name</code> - The name of the project that needs to be built first</li>
</ul>
<p>An example might look like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;project name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
	&lt;dependencies&gt;
		&lt;dependency name=&quot;libFoo&quot;/&gt;	
	&lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

<pre>&lt;project name=&quot;libFoo&quot;&gt;
	&lt;dependencies&gt;
		&lt;dependency name=&quot;libBar&quot;/&gt;	
	&lt;/dependencies&gt;	
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

<pre>&lt;project name=&quot;libBar&quot;&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

<p>This gets resolved to project &quot;foo&quot; depends on project &quot;libFoo&quot;
which in turn depends on project &quot;libBar&quot;, so the build order becomes
libBar, libFoo, and finally foo.
</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;configurations&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>Configurations are the heart of <code>xmake</code>. If you have used Microsoft's

        Visual C++ then you'll be right at home here. Basically a configuration

        is a complete set of settings for compiler and linker in order to build

        the project. A single project may have multiple configurations, for

        example you might have a &quot;Win32 Debug&quot;, &quot;Win32

        Release&quot;, &quot;Linux Debug&quot;, &quot;Linux Release&quot;,

        &quot;Mac Debug&quot;, and &quot;Mac Release&quot;. Thus, in order for <code>

        xmake</code> to do it's job it needs to know the configuration you want to

        build. The &lt;configurations&gt; tag is used to indicate the collection, and then a
        series of 1 or more &lt;config&gt; sub tags for each configuration. A configuration has the following attributes:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><code>name</code> - The configuration name identifies the

            configuration, and is used by source files to identify which

            configuration they belong to. A configuration name can only have the

            characters [a..z, A..Z, 0..9] the &quot;|&quot; is used to separate

            multiple configurations.

          <li><code>srcBinaryExt</code> - the srcBinaryExt is used to identify

            the extension of compiled source files. Many compilers use

            &quot;.o&quot; while many others use &quot;.obj&quot;. For example,

            GCC/G++ uses &quot;.o&quot; for it's extension for object files,

            while VC++ uses &quot;.obj&quot;. This allows you to specify just

            the name of your output files (without the &quot;.&quot; extension)

            and let <code> xmake</code> append the correct extension based on the

            configuration currently being built.&nbsp;</li>

        </ul>

        <p>An example looks something like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;config name=&quot;VC++ Debug&quot; srcBinaryExt=&quot;.obj&quot;&gt;

.... more stuff follows</pre>

        <p>Besides the above attributes, the configuration also has the

        following sub tags:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><code>includes</code> - The includes section informs <code> xmake</code> of

            where to look for include files not in the current directory. This

            is used during the dependency scan for source files.&nbsp;

          <li><code>tools</code> - The tools sections allows you to specify

            special build tools for build source files that are not able to be

            compiled using the <code><samp>compiler</samp></code> and <code>linker</code>

            in the configuration.

          <li><code>compiler</code> - This specifies the compiler used to

            compile source files (unless the source file specifies another <code>tool</code>).

          <li><code>linker</code> -&nbsp;This specifies the linker used to

            create the final project binary.&nbsp;

          <li><code>preBuild</code> - not implemented yet.

          <li><code>postBuild</code> - not implemented yet.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;includes&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>This allows you to specify a set of directories to look in when

        resolving dependencies for what to build. Each include directory

        requires an include tag. Each include tag has a single attribute:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><code>path</code> - Where path is a directory path that will get

            added to the list of directory paths to search for when determining

            dependencies.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>An example looks something like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;includes&gt;
	&lt;include path=&quot;../../MyDir/includes&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/includes&gt;

.... more stuff follows</pre>

        <p>By default the directory where the source file lives is search in the

        dependency check.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;tools&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>&nbsp;The tools tag allows you to specify 0 or more tools that can be

        used to build a specific type of file. The association of tool to a

        source file is done with a source's &quot;tool&quot; attribute&nbsp;

        having the same value as the tool's &quot;id&quot; attribute. Each tool

        is described in a &lt;tool&gt; tag with the following attributes:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><code>name</code> - the name of the tool executable, such as

            &quot;rc.exe&quot;. You can specify a full or relative path.</li>

          <li><code>id</code> - the text name of the tool. This is the name that

            the various source entries will refer to the tool as. It can be

            anything you want, so long as you consistently refer to it.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Each tool tag can have flags associated with it. This is done by

        using the &lt;flags&gt; tag to indicate the collection, and then a

        &lt;flag&gt; sub tag. Each flag has the following attributes:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>value - the text parameters you want to pass to the tool</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The flags are then appended to on another to create a command line

        that is then sent to the tool when needed. </p>

        <p>An example looks something like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;tools&gt;
	&lt;tool name=&quot;rc.exe&quot; id=&quot;rc&quot; &gt; &lt;!-- here we are using just the resource compilers file name, 
                                            assuming it can be found on the system path --&gt;
        	&lt;flags&gt;
			&lt;flag value=&quot;/i'..\..\MyResIncludes' \d '_DEBUG'&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/flags&gt;
	&lt;/tool&gt;        
&lt;/tools&gt;
.... more stuff follows</pre>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;compiler&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>The compiler tag allows you to specify the executable to use as your
        compiler (for a given configuration) and a set of flags to send to the
        compiler when processing source files.&nbsp; The compiler tag has only a
        single attribute:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>name - the relative or full path name to the executable to use for
            compiling source files. If the name is just the short name (i.e.
            &quot;cl.exe&quot;), then it is assumed that it can be found on the
            system path.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The compiler can have flags associated with it. This is done by

        using the &lt;flags&gt; tag to indicate the collection, and then a

        &lt;flag&gt; sub tag. Each flag has the following attributes:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>value - the text parameters you want to pass to the compiler</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The flags are then appended to on another to create a command line

        that is sent to the compiler when it is invoked for each source file.</p>

        <p>An example looks something like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;compiler name=&quot;cl&quot;&gt;
	&lt;flags&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/I $(INC)&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/nologo /MDd /W3 /Gm /GR /GX /ZI /Od&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/D WIN32 /D _DEBUG /D _CONSOLE /D _MBCS /D FOUNDATIONKIT_DLL /D FOUNDATIONKIT_EXPORTS&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/c&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;/flags&gt;
&lt;/compiler &gt;

.... more stuff follows</pre>

        <p>Note the use of the variable <code>INC</code> in the first flag. Also
        note that you could have just as easily put everything in one flag, but
        breaking it up makes it easier to read for others.</p>

        <p>Please note: Use single quote's where you would use						double quotes.
        Single quote characters will be expanded to double quote when the string is parsed and prepared to send to the						compiler.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;linker&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>The linker tag allows you to specify the executable to use as your
        linker (for a given configuration) and a set of flags to send to the
        linker when linking all the compiler object code.&nbsp; The linker tag
        has only a single attribute:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>name - the relative or full path name to the executable to use for
            linking object files. If the name is just the short name (i.e.
            &quot;link.exe&quot;), then it is assumed that it can be found on
            the system path.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The linker can have flags associated with it. This is done by

        using the &lt;flags&gt; tag to indicate the collection, and then a

        &lt;flag&gt; sub tag. Each flag has the following attributes:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>value - the text parameters you want to pass to the linker&nbsp;</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The flags are then appended to on another to create a command line

        that is sent to the linker when it is invoked to build the final binary
        image for the project.</p>

        <p>An example looks something like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;linker name=&quot;link.exe&quot;&gt;
	&lt;flags&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/nologo&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/subsystem:console&quot;/&gt;					
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/incremental:yes&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/pdb:'Debug/xmake.pdb'&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/debug&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/machine:I386&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/out:'Debug/xmake.exe'&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;flag value=&quot;/pdbtype:sept&quot;/&gt;		
	&lt;/flags&gt;
&lt;/linker&gt;

.... more stuff follows</pre>

        <p>Please note: Use single quote's where you would use						double quotes.
        Single quote characters will be expanded to double quote						when the string is parsed and prepared to send to the
        linker .&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;preBuild&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>This allows you
        to specify a series of command line actions to execute <b><i>prior</i></b>
        to the compile phase of the build process. preBuild is part of the
        configuration tag and is thus associated with a specific
        configuration.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The syntax looks like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;prebuild&gt;
	&lt;exec commandLine=&quot;copy Foo.cpp ../../outputSrc&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;!-- ...other commands --&gt;
&lt;/prebuild&gt;

.... more stuff follows</pre>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;postBuild&gt;</code></h4>

<p>This allows you
        to specify a series of command line actions to execute <b><i>after</i></b>
        the link phase of the build process. postBuild is part of the
        configuration tag and is thus associated with a specific
        configuration.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The syntax looks like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;postbuild&gt;
	&lt;!-- in this example we use doxygen to autogenerate
		source documentation--&gt;
	&lt;exec commandLine=&quot;doxygen ../../help/Doxyfile&quot;/&gt; 
	&lt;!-- ...other commands --&gt;
&lt;/postbuild&gt;

.... more stuff follows</pre>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h4><code>&lt;sources&gt;</code></h4>

        <p>After the configurations are all specified you list you source files
        that are required to build your project. The sources tag is a collection
        of 1 or more source sub tags, with each source sub tag representing an
        individual source file to build. The source tag has the following
        attributes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>name</code> - this is the name of the source file, relative
            to the directory where the project is being built. This attribute is
            required.</li>
          <li><code>partOfConfig</code> -&nbsp;this indicates which
            configuration the source file will compile under. The name of the
            configuration <b><i>must</i></b> exactly match the name of the
            configuration specified in one of the config sections that was
            defined earlier in the makefile. If the source file can be compiled
            under multiple configurations, then each configuration name must be
            separated by the &quot;|&quot; character. This attribute is
            required.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><code>build</code> -&nbsp;indicates whether the file should even
            be built for this configuration. The possible values for this
            attribute are &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. This attribute is
            optional. If you do not specify this then it defaults to
            &quot;yes&quot;, meaning the file will be compiled.</li>
          <li><code>outputAs</code> -&nbsp;this tells <code>xmake</code> where
            the compiled object file should go. This will override the settings
            in the compiler flags. Generally you want the two to match. By
            specifying this <code>xmake</code> knows where to go to clean up the
            object files during a &quot;clean&quot;. This attribute is optional.
            If you do not specify this then it defaults to the directory where
            the project's makefile is. When specifying the name of the output
            file you can leave off the extension (like foo.o or baz.obj) and
            xmake will determine the proper extension from the configuration's <code>srcBinaryExt</code> 
            attribute.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><code>tool</code> - tells <code>xmake</code> that the source file
            is not compiled using the default compiler, instead it is to be
            &quot;compiled&quot; using the tool whose <code>id</code> attribute
            matches this attribute's value. The two values must match exactly.
            If a tool does not exist in the makefile with a matching <code>id</code>
            attribute then the source file is not compiled. This attribute is
            required.&nbsp; </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example looks something like this:</p>

        <pre>&lt;sources&gt;
	&lt;source name=&quot;Test1Make.rc&quot; partOfConfig=&quot;VC++ Debug&quot; outputAs=&quot;Debug/Test1Make.res&quot; tool=&quot;rc&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;source name=&quot;StdAfx.cpp&quot; partOfConfig=&quot;VC++ Debug&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;source name=&quot;MainFrm.cpp&quot; partOfConfig=&quot;VC++ Debug&quot; outputAs=&quot;Debug/MainFrm.obj&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;source name=&quot;ChildView.cpp&quot; partOfConfig=&quot;VC++ Debug&quot; outputAs=&quot;Debug/ChildView.obj&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;source name=&quot;Test1Make.cpp&quot; partOfConfig=&quot;VC++ Debug&quot; outputAs=&quot;Debug/Test1Make.obj&quot;/&gt;						
&lt;/sources&gt;</pre>

        <p>Note the use of the tool attribute in the first source tag.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Building and installing <code>xmake</code></h3>
        <p>You can get <code>xmake</code> from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcf">here</a>
        at the Source Forge VCF project page. You can build for Win32 systems
        using the VC++ workspace that is included. Alternately it can be built
        using GCC on 'nix systems using the traditional <code>configure</code>, <code>make</code>,
        <code>make install</code> commands (a configure and Makefile are
        provided for this). </p>
        <p>It has been built and tested on Windows 2000, Windows NT sp4 (it is a
        fairly simple command line tool so it should work fine in Windows 98 and
        Windows XP), linux 2.4 (RH7.1 distro), SparcStation with Solaris 8
        (2.8), and I have heard it runs on MacOSX and VMS but I have not
        personally verified this. </p>
        <p>To install it under Win32 systems just put the executable where you
        want, preferably someplace that is on your system path. For 'nix systems
        the <code>make install</code> command will put it in <code>/usr/bin</code>,
        or you can place it somewhere else if you want.</p>
