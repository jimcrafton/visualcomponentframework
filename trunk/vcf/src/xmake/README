This short set of instructions shows you how to build and setup 
xmake for usage on unix or Win32 systems.


Unix/Linux based systems
Building
 - unpack the xmake-XXXX.tar.gz file somewhere
 - cd to xmake-XXX
 - make
 this will build the xmake static lib and the xmake executable

Installing
 - make install
 this will install the xmake in /usr/local/bin - if you need it to 
 go somewhere else open the Makefile and change the INSTALLDIR variable
 to something more appropriate

Documentation
 - make docs 
 this will generate the docbook based documentation. It will generate
 html docs and HTML Help project files in the xmake-XXX/docs directory.


Win32 using Visual Studio
Building
 - unpack the xmake-XXXX.tar.gz file somewhere
 - cd to xmake-XXX
 - open the xmake.dsw workspace in Visual C++ 6.0 (sp5) and
 build the xmake project.

Installing
 - copy the xmake executable to wherever is most convenient for you and
 can be seen by your PATH.

Documentation
 - documentation comes with the distro, see xmake-XXX/docs/xmake_docs.chm.

For more information about xmake (or the Visual Component Framework of which 
it is a part) please see http://vcf.sf.net and/or http://sf.net/projects/vcf.
