/** \page cometlwlock Lightweight Lock
  This lightweight lock class was adapted from samples and ideas that
  were put across the ATL mailing list. It is a non-starving, kernel-
  free lock that does not order writer requests. It is optimized for
  use with resources that can take multiple simultaneous reads,
  particularly when writing is only an occasional task.

  Multiple readers may acquire the lock without any interference with
  one another. As soon as a writer requests the lock, additional
  readers will spin. When the pre-writer readers have all given up
  control of the lock, the writer will obtain it. After the writer
  has rescinded control, the additional readers will gain access
  to the locked resource.

  This class is very lightweight. It does not use any kernel objects.
  It is designed for rapid access to resources without requiring
  code to undergo process and ring changes. Because the "spin"
  method for this lock is "Sleep(0)", it is a good idea to keep
  the lock only long enough for short operations; otherwise, CPU
  will be wasted spinning for the lock. You can change the spin
  mechanism by #define'ing COMET_LW_LOCK_SPIN before including this
  header file.

  VERY VERY IMPORTANT: If you have a lock open with read access and
  attempt to get write access as well, you will deadlock! Always
  rescind your read access before requesting write access (and,
  of course, don't rely on any read information across this).

  This lock works in a single process only. It cannot be used, as is,
  for cross-process synchronization. To do that, you should convert
  this lock to using a semaphore and mutex, or use shared memory to
  avoid kernel objects.
