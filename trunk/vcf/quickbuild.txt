Quick Build Instructions for Win32

This will briefly cover the basics of building the VCF binaries using Microsoft's 
Visual C++ IDE versions 6, 7, or 7.1. For more details on this please see the 
VCF documentation installed with MSDN, or view it online at 
http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/. Additional information is also provided 
for users of Intel's C/C++ compiler.

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.  The following section deals with building the VCF libraries 
using the Microsoft Visual C++ 6 IDE.

To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc60/vcfAllProjects.dsw workspace. This workspace 
has all the various framework projects, both as static .lib files and DLL projects. 
To build all the VCF libraries select the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active 
project. Building this project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries will be built as 
both static and DLL binaries. To build just the static libraries, build the 
"vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To build all the libraries as DLL's, build the 
"vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.

There are several additional projects you can build as well for additional features.


The ImageFormats project, which adds support for a wide variety of image formats 
by using the FreeImage library. Build this if you would like to add this support 
to your project.



The Win32HTMLBrowser (and Win32HTMLBrowser_StaticLib) project, for an HTML browser 
peer (currently implemented using the Internet Explorer IWebBrowser COM interface, 
though experiments have been done using the Gecko component from mozilla).


The build will take a bit, so now would be a good time for coffee, tea, or perhaps 
reading some Dostoevsky...

Once the build is finished you are ready to go ! All binaries will be put in the 
vcf/bin directory when built.

Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0.  The following section deals with building the VCF libraries 
using the Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0 IDE.

To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc70/vcfAllProjects_vc70.dsw workspace. This 
workspace has all the various framework projects, both as static .lib files and DLL 
projects. Visual Studio should prompt you to convert the Visual C++ 6 projects into 
the new Visual Studio 7 format. Click the "Yes to All" option, and all the projects 
should then get converted. To build all the VCF libraries select the "vcfAllLibs" 
project and make it the active project. Building this project will automatically 
build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. 
The libraries will be built as both static and DLL binaries. To build just the static 
libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To build all the libraries as DLL's, 
build the "vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.

Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.  The following section deals with building the VCF libraries 
using the Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 IDE.

To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc71/vcfAllProjects_vc71.dsw workspace. This 
workspace has all the various framework projects, both as static .lib files and DLL 
projects. Visual Studio should prompt you to convert the Visual C++ 6 projects into 
the new Visual Studio 7.1 format. Click the "Yes to All" option, and all the projects 
should then get converted.

To build all the VCF libraries select the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active 
project.

Building this project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries will be built as 
both static and DLL binaries. To build just the static libraries, build the 
"vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To build all the libraries as DLL's, build the 
"vcfAllDynamicLibs" project. After having built the VCF for the first time, you 
can typically open the vcf/build/vc71/vcfAllProjects_vc71.sln solution file 
instead of the workspace file should you decide to rebuild any of the projects 
at a later time.

Microsoft Visual C++ 6 using the Intel C/C++ compiler.  The following section deals 
with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0 IDE with the 
Intel C/C++ compiler installed.

To build the VCF open the vcf/build/icl7/vcfAllProjects_icl7.dsw workspace. This 
workspace has all the various framework projects, both as static .lib files and 
DLL projects. To build all the VCF libraries select the "vcfAllLibs" project and 
make it the active project. Building this project will automatically build the 
FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The 
libraries will be built as both static and DLL binaries. To build just the static 
libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To build all the libraries as 
DLL's, build the "vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.
