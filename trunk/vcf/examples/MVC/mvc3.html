<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/library/vcfmvc2.aspx">previous 
article</a> began developing a application based on useing the MVC
pattern. This article will continue along those lines, demonstrating
how to share a single model with more than one view/control, using
menu items, status bars, mouse selection, modification of various
shape attributes, and interactive scaling, translation, and rotation
of a selected shape using the mouse. Some of the things discussed 
here don't <i>exactly</i> fall under the topic of MVC, but instead 
demonstrate how to make a full fldged application using the 
framework.
</p>
<h2>Code refactoring</h2>
<p>
The first things we'll do is move the controller class into it's 
own header. This makes the application class code a bit cleaner to read.
</p>
<h2>Updating the UI</h2>
<p>
Next we're going to change the UI. We're going to divide the main
window into two halves, the left side will contain a list view of all
the shapes in the current model, and the right side will hold our 
graphical view of the model. We'll use a splitter to allow us to manipulate
the sizing of both halves:
<pre>
object Scribble4Window  : VCF::Window
  object contentPanel : VCF::Panel
    alignment = AlignClient
    border = null
  end
  
  object scribbleListing : VCF::ListViewControl
    alignment = AlignLeft
    width = 100pt
    border = null
    iconStyle = isDetails		
  end
  
  object splitter : VCF::Splitter 		
  end
end
</pre>
This will create our UI with it's 3 basic components. The contentPanel will
now become linked to our SplitterView instance. Before we do that let's introduce
an new element in our RTTI declarations: fields. 
</p>
<p>
We can use VCF's RTTI fields to link a component declared in the VFF resource to
a member variable in the C++ class. So we can associate the contentPanel object
declared above with :
<pre>
class Scribble4Window : public Window {
public:
  Scribble4Window() {
    
  }
  virtual ~Scribble4Window(){};
  
  Panel* contentPanel;
};
</pre>
We do this by using the _field_obj_ macro like so:
<pre>
_class_rtti_(Scribble4Window, "VCF::Window", "Scribble4Window")
_field_obj_( Panel*, contentPanel )
_class_rtti_end_
</pre>
Presto! After the Scribble4Window is created and loaded with the contents
of the VFF resource, the contentPanel will point to the correct instance.
This means we don't have to use the Component::findComponent() method.
</p>
<p>
Now hooking up the view to the it's new control looks like:
<pre>
class Scribble4App : public Application {
public:
  virtual bool initRunningApplication(){
    
    //rest omitted
    
    ScribbleController* controller = new ScribbleController();
    controller->setName( "controller" );
    addComponent(controller);
  
  
    Scribble4Window* mainWindow = (Scribble4Window*) Frame::createWindow( classid(Scribble4Window) );
    setMainWindow(mainWindow);
    
    ScribbleView* view = new ScribbleView();
    mainWindow->contentPanel->setView( view );
    mainWindow->scribble->addView( view );
    
    
    controller->setControl( mainWindow->contentPanel );
    controller->setModel( mainWindow->scribble );
    //rest omitted
    return result;
  }
};
</pre>
When Frame::createWindow() returns, the mainWindow->contentPanel is valid and we
can use it, in this case to set the view of the content panel, and add the
view to the scribble model.
</p>
<p>
In our app we have a the scribble view which renders the content of the 
scribble model. However, what if we wanted an alternate display of the 
data? For example, perhaps we want a list of all the shapes that make up 
the scribble model? No problem, that's why we added a list control,
and set it's model to our instance of a scribble model. This works because
models may have more than one view/control hooked up to it.
</p>
<p>
To do this, lets adjust our UI accordingly, altering the vff resource like so:
<pre>  
object scribbleListing : VCF::ListViewControl
  //rest omitted
  model = @scribble  
end
</pre>
This assigns the list control's model to our scribble model instance. Because
the scribble model is based on a ListModel, the list control can display all
the shapes in the list. When the model is changed, the list's UI is updated 
automatically.
</p>


<h2>Status</h2>
<p>
A status bar is simple to  - we just use the StatusBar class. We don't 
need to specify any alignment, it's default is bottom alignment, which
for our purposes is just fine. 
<pre>  
object status : VCF::StatusBar
  height = 15pt
  status[0] = 'Status: '
  status[1] = 'Dimensions: NNN x NNN'
  status[2] = 'Coords: NNNN, NNNN'
end
</pre>
Assigning "segments" is pretty simple - we just access the status property
and pass in some string labels. 
</p>

<h2>Menus</h2>
<p>
Let's add some menus to make the application a bit more interesting. We'll 
add a simple Help > About... menu and a View menu that will allow us to 
toggle the visibility of our list on the left side and our status bar on
the bottom.
<pre>
object mainMenu : VCF::MenuBar
  object help : VCF::DefaultMenuItem
    caption = '&View'
    object viewListing : VCF::DefaultMenuItem
      caption = 'Shape &Listing'
      checked = true
      delegates
        MenuItemClicked = [Scribble4App@Scribble4App::onViewListing]
      end
    end

    object viewStatusbar : VCF::DefaultMenuItem
      caption = '&Status Bar'
      checked = true
      delegates
        MenuItemClicked = [Scribble4App@Scribble4App::onViewStatusbar]
      end
    end
  end

  object help : VCF::DefaultMenuItem
    caption = '&Help'
    object helpAbout : VCF::DefaultMenuItem
      caption = '&About...'
      delegates
        MenuItemClicked = [Scribble4App@Scribble4App::onAbout]
      end
    end
  end
end	
</pre>
This is fairly self explanatory, the MenuItemClicked is the delegate
that's fired when a user clicks on a menu item. The display will use the
ampersand("&") as a mnemonic, adding the "_" underbar to menu item captions.
The MenuBar is top level menu - you need only one of these. The rest of your
menu hierarchy, made of MenuItems, is constructed underneath. 
</p>
<p>
The code for modifying the visibility of the status bar or the list control
is pretty standard: 
<pre>
void onViewListing( Event* e ) {
  Scribble4Window* mainWindow = (Scribble4Window*)getMainWindow();
  mainWindow->scribbleListing->setVisible( !mainWindow->scribbleListing->getVisible() );
  MenuItem* item = (MenuItem*)e->getSource();
  item->setChecked( mainWindow->scribbleListing->getVisible() );
}
</pre>
We toggle the visibility of the mainWindow->scribbleListing control, then
we alter the menu item that fired this event. Call MenuItem::setChecked()
will toggle whether or not the menu item displays a check box to the
left of the item caption.
