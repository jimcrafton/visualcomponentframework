<section><title>HelloWorld3</title>
	<para>
	The purpose of this example is to demonstrate creating not only 
	our own custom application class, but our first case of deriving 
	a new window class. As before, we'll build on what we learned in the
	HelloWorld and HelloWorld2 examples.
	</para>
	<para>
	We'll create another class in this example, this time deriving from VCF::Window.
	The only methods we'll implement are the constructor, and we'll put the code that
	was previously in the application's initRunningApplication() method, and move it
	to our window's constructor. So let's create a window class:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class HelloWorld3Window : public VCF::Window {
public:
	HelloWorld3Window() {
	}
};
]]>
</programlisting>	
	</para>
	<para>
	Next we'll start setting various properties of the window. First let's change the window's
	title, or caption. To do this we just have to call the VCF::Window::setCaption() method
	and pass in a string.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class HelloWorld3Window : public VCF::Window {
public:
	HelloWorld3Window() {
	  //get the current running application
	  Application* runningApp = Application::getRunningInstance();
	  
	  //get the app's name
	  String appname = runningApp->getName();
	  
	  //set the caption!
	  setCaption( appname + " - Hello World!" );
	}
};
]]>
	</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	Now we'll set the bounds, just like we did in the HelloWorld2 example.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class HelloWorld3Window : public VCF::Window {
public:
	HelloWorld3Window() {
	  //code omitted for clarity
	  Rect bounds( 100.0, 100.0, 500.0, 500.0 );
	  setBounds( &bounds );
	}
};
]]>
</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	Finally we'll show the window. Note that this time we are going to use the setVisible() method
	of the Window class, as opposed to the show() method - for our purposes they perform the 
	same functionality.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class HelloWorld3Window : public VCF::Window {
public:
	HelloWorld3Window() {
	  //code omitted for clarity
	  setVisible( true );
	}
};
]]>
	</programlisting>
	</para>
</section>
