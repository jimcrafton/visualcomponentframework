<section><title>Strings</title>
	<para>
	This will provide a brief overview of how to use the String class in the VCF. 
	For more details on this see the String class in the source documentation and 
	the <link linkend="FK_Strings">Strings</link> section in the FoundationKit 
	reference manual.
	</para>
	<section><title>Concatenating Strings</title>
	<para>
	You can easily add to a string by using the "+=" operator or "+" operator. 
	The String class has essentially the same interface that the STL's 
	basic_string class uses	so any STL experience pays off with regards to 
	the VCF's String class. You can assign strings through the "=" operator
	or using the String's constructor. For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
String s1("Hello");
String s2 = "Hello";
String s3;
s3 += s2 + " World";
System::println( s3 );//outputs "Hello World"
	]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	</section>
	
	
	<section><title>Finding substrings</title>
	<para>
	You can search a String just like you can an STL string using 
	the String's find() function. It works exactly like the STL 
	basic_string::find() does. For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
String s = "here's some text.";
size_t pos = s.find("here");
if ( pos != String::npos ) {
	System::println( "Found the string!" );
}

pos = s.find("Huck Finn");
if ( pos == String::npos ) {
	System::println( "Didn't find the string!" );
}
	]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	</section>
	
	<section><title>Extracting substrings</title>
	<para>
	You can extract a a substring from a String just like you can 
	an STL string using the String's substr() function. It works 
	exactly like the STL basic_string::substr() does. For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
String s = "here's some text.";
System::println( s.substr( s.find("some"), 4 ) ); //prints out "some"
	]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	</section>
	
	<section><title>Formatting with the Format class</title>
	<para>
	In the VCF we've gone out of our way to get rid of the usage of 
	variable argument functions for string formatting. Typically 
	you might use printf or sprintf to do this. In the VCF we use
	the Format class to do this. The Format constructor takes a
	formatting string, and the Format class provides an overload
	of the "%" operator to add variable arguments. For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[	
String s = Format("Say hello %d times.") % 100; //s will equal "Say hello 100 times."	
	]]></programlisting>
	You can format strings easily - you can pass in the whole string
	object, as opposed to just passing in a pointer to the character
	data.
<programlisting><![CDATA[	
String myName = "Bobby Fillagutty";
String s = Format("My name is %s.") % myName; //s will equal "My name is Bobby Fillagutty."	
	]]></programlisting>	
	</para>
	
	<para>
	You can format multiple arguments by simply following the previous
	argument with another "%" operator. Since the Format's "%" operator 
	overload returns a reference to the Format object, you can easily
	use it for a variable number of arguments. For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
System::println( Format("The planet %s orbits at a distance of %u AU from the Sun.") % "Krypton" % 100000 );
	]]></programlisting>
	This will output "The planet Krypton orbits at a distance of 100000 AU from the Sun.".
	</para>
	<para>
	The formatting codes for the Format class are identical to those
	used for printf or sprintf.
	</para>
	</section>
	
	<section><title>Strings and other types</title>
	<para>
	There are concatenation operators provided for various primitive types 
	to make it easy to form more complex strings. For example, you can 
	concatenate integer values or even bool values to a string:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
String bigString = String("Some info is ")  + true + " but some is worth " + 100.342 + " times it's weight in gold." ;
	]]></programlisting>
	The value of the string will be "Some info is true but some is worth 100.342 times it's weight in gold.".
	</para>
	<para>
	You can concatenate complex objects as well, so long as the class derives in some way from VCF::Object.
	For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
class Foo : public VCF::Object {
public:
	virtual VCF::String toString() {
		return VCF::String("Foo here!\n\t") + Object::toString();
	}
};

Foo f;
System::println( String("f is: ") + f + "\n" + 99.5643231 + " bottles of " + &f + " on the wall!" );
	]]></programlisting>
	The Foo's toString() function will be called to convert the foo instance to a string.
	</para>
	</section>
	
	
	<section><title>Extracting type names</title>
	<para>
	You can extract the type name of a primitive type by using the typeid() operator,
	in conjunction with a string. This is not the same as calling the 
	type_info::name() function. The difference is that the VCF makes certain guarantees
	about what is returned. For example, if you call typeid(int).name() using 
	Microsoft Visual C++, you get "int" returned, however the same code when
	compiled with GCC's G++ will output "i" (or maybe something different, it may
	depend on the version). The VCF string extraction routines will always
	output "int". For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
int i = 0;
bool j = false;
const double* k = NULL;
float l = 0;	
System::println( "i is a " + typeid(i) + " type" );
System::println( "j is a " + typeid(j) + " type" );
System::println( "k is a " + typeid(k) + " type" );
System::println( "l is a " + typeid(l) + " type" );
	]]></programlisting>
	This will output 
	<screen>
i is a int type
j is a bool type
k is a double const * type
l is a float type
	</screen>	
	</para>
	</section>
	
	<section><title>Changing case</title>
	<para>
	You can change the case of a string by using the StringUtils::lowerCase() and 
	StringUtils::upperCase(). Both functions take a string reference and 
	<emphasis>modify</emphasis> this string. So if we had:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
String s = "Some text to chAngE.";
StringUtils::upperCase(s); 
	]]></programlisting>
	The variable "s" is now uppercased to "SOME TEXT TO CHANGE.", as opposed to 
	returning a new string. If you don't want to have the original string modified
	then you need to make a copy of it. For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
String s = "Some text to chAngE.";
String s2 = s;
StringUtils::upperCase(s2); 
	]]></programlisting>
	The uppercase/lowercase conversion is not locale or culture sensitive. If you 
	want an accurate case conversion that takes the locale into consideration,
	then use the Locale class's Locale::toLowerCase() and Locale::toUpperCase().
	</para>	
	</section>
	
	<section><title>Converting types to a String</title>
	<para>
	You can convert an int, long, double, and so on, to a string by using the
	StringUtils::toString() functions. For example:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
String val = StringUtils::toString( 12 );
System::println( Format("value: %s") % val );

val = StringUtils::toString( 1234.009459034 );
System::println( Format("value: %s") % val );

val = StringUtils::toString( 53433.000034f );
System::println( Format("value: %s") % val );

val = StringUtils::toString( true );
System::println( Format("value: %s") % val );

val = StringUtils::toString( false );
System::println( Format("value: %s") % val );
	]]></programlisting>
	This will output:
	<screen>
value: 12
value: 1234.00946
value: 53433.00000
value: true
value: false	
	</screen>
	</para>
	</section>
	
	<section><title>Trimming a String</title>
	Strings can be trimmed using the StringUtils::trim(), StringUtils::trimLeft(), 
	and StringUtils::trimRight() functions. These all take a string source reference to 
	operate on, and a string of characters to trim from the source.
