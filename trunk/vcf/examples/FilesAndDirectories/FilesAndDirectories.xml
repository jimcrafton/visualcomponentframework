<section><title>Files and Directories</title>
	<para>
	This example will demonstrate using the various file and directory 
	classes for working with the underlying filesystem. 
	</para>
	<formalpara><title>File names and the FilePath class</title>
	The first part we'll look at is dealing with file names. To make this
	easier to work with, the VCF uses a special class called the FilePath
	class. This class allows you to deal with the various parts of a file
	name string, such as extracting the directory, or just the file extension.
	</formalpara>
	<para>
	Using a FilePath object is easy - just assign a string to it.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
FilePath fileName = "tmp-output.txt";
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	Now we can check to see if the file name is a relative file name or
	a fully qualified file name.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
if ( fileName.isRelativePath() ) {		
	fileName = fileName.expandRelativePathName( System::getCurrentWorkingDirectory() );
}
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	Calling the fileName.isRelativePath() method will return true if it's a relative
	path, or false otherwise. If the file name is relative, then we can expand the 
	file name by calling expandRelativePathName(). Note that this returns a string
	that represents the fully qualified file name, but the original data for the
	FilePath object is <emphasis>unmodified</emphasis>.
	</para>
	<para>
	We can examine the various parts of the file name quite easily, like so:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
String drive = fileName.getDriveName();
String directoryPath = fileName.getPathName();
String name = fileName.getName();
String extension = fileName.getExtension();
String nativeOSFilePath = fileName.transformToOSSpecific();
]]>	
</programlisting>
	Each of these functions, getDriveName(), getPathName(), getName(),
	and getExtension(), extracts the various data from the original FilePath
	object, again, it makes no modifications to do so. This is roughly analagous to
	Microsoft's _splitpath() C Runtime function.
	</para>
	<para>
	In addition to extracting the various path components, you can also get
	an vector of strings for the directory components. For example, a directory
	such as "C:\Program Files\A Program\User Settings\Stuff.txt" would have 
	3 strings, "Program Files", "A Program", and "User Settings".
	You can enumerate these like so:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
std::vector<String> pathComponents = fileName.getPathComponents();
std::vector<String>::iterator it = pathComponents.begin();
while ( it != pathComponents.end() ) {
	System::println( *it );
	it ++;
}
]]>	
</programlisting>	
	</para>
	<formalpara><title>Creating a file</title>
	You can create files (as well as read and write to them) using the 
	FileOutputStream class. To create a file, just create an isntance of 
	FileOutputStream, and pass in the file name to the constructor. Then
	use the various write() methods of the FileOutputStream class. For 
	example, lets create a file, write some text to it, and then display
	the file size:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
FileOutputStream fs(fileName);
String text = "here's some text to put in the file";
fs << text;
System::println( "FileOutputStream current size: %d", fs.getSize() );
]]>
</programlisting>	
	</formalpara>
	<para>
	Now lets look at accessing the same file that we just created with the 
	File object. With the VCF::File object we can get information about the
	file attributes, such as size. To do this all we need to do is create a 
	File object and pass in a file name to the File's constructor.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
File file( fileName ); 
System::println( "The file %s's size: %d", fileName.getFileName().c_str(), file.getSize() );
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	As we can see this is extremely easy to do. Now lets copy the file somewhere else:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
file.copyTo( fileName.getPathName(true) + 
			FilePath::getDirectorySeparator() + 
			fileName.getName() + "-copy" + fileName.getExtension() );
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	To accomplish this, we just call the File's copyTo() method, and pass in 
	the file name that we are copying to. If this fails, an exception will be thrown,
	so we may want to wrap this in a try/catch block like so:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
try {
	file.copyTo( fileName.getPathName(true) + 
				FilePath::getDirectorySeparator() + 
				fileName.getName() + "-copy" + fileName.getExtension() );
}
catch ( BasicException& e ) {
	System::println( "Oops, couldn't copy the file, error: " + e.getMessage() );
}
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	</para>
	<formalpara><title>File searches</title>
	The last things we'll look at is search for files. To do this we will use 
	a directory	object, and a Directory::Finder object. A directory is somewhat
	similar to a File object, but obviously is specific to just directories. To
	actually search for files, you call the Directory::findFiles() method.
	</formalpara>
