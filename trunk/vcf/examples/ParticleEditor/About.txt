Particle Editor VCF example application, by Alan Fischer:

To see it in action, load one of the sample particle effects from the File menu, such as:

fireworks.xml
fountain.xml
papers.xml

(smoke.xml and sparks.xml are part of the fireworks)

There is the option to build it with and without GLEW.  If built with GLEW, it will use
vertex programs if available.  The only difference is the ones with vertex programs will
probably be faster.  They will look the same.

The Trailing System is the name of a particle system to attach to each particle in the current
system.

The Ending System is the name of a particle system to fire at the end of each particles life in
the current system.

See fireworks.xml for an example of this.

Save a particle effect with the File, Save option.
