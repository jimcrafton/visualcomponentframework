<section><title>MVC Basics</title>
	<para>
		This example will discuss the basics of using and creating 
		a custom model, view, and control classes that make use of the 
		VCF's MVC architecture. Our example will create a simple model 
		class that contains a series of cirlce shapes. We'll demonstrate
		5 different ways to work with and put it together with the 
		VCF's control's, custom views, and a custom controller.
	</para>
	<formalpara><title>Defining the CircleModel</title>
	The first thing we'll start with is the model. Our model will be a collection
	for circles, and we'll define it's interface like so:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class CircleModel  {
public:

	void addCircle( const CircleShape& circle ) {
		circles_.push_back( circle );
	}

	void addCircle( const Point& pt, const double& radius ) {
		addCircle( CircleShape(pt,radius) );
	}
	
	void removeCircle( const CircleShape& circle ) {
		std::vector<CircleShape>::iterator found = std::find( circles_.begin(), circles_.end(), circle );
		if ( found != circles_.end() ) {
			circles_.erase( found );
		}
	}

	CircleShape& getCircle( int index ) {
		return circles_.at(index);
	}

	const CircleShape& getCircle( int index ) const {
		return circles_.at(index);
	}

	std::vector<CircleShape>& getCircles() {
		return circles_;
	}

	const std::vector<CircleShape>& getCircles() const {
		return circles_;
	}

	int size() const {
		return circles_.size();
	}
protected:
	std::vector<CircleShape> circles_;
};

]]>	
	</programlisting>
	Our model has a collection (an std::vector to be precise) of CircleShapes. The 
	CircleShape is defined as 
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class CircleShape {
public:

	CircleShape( const Point& pt, const double& radius ) :  center_(pt), radius_(radius) {}

	CircleShape():radius_(0.0){}
	
	bool operator==( const CircleShape& rhs ) const{
		return 	center_ == rhs.center_ && radius_ == rhs.radius_;
	}

	Point center_;
	double radius_;
};
]]>
	</programlisting>
	At this point we have specified our custom pieces for the model and how we can alter
	(add or remove) shapes from the model.
	</formalpara>
	
	<para>
	Next we'll actually turn the class into a VCF compatible model. For this we need to derive
	directly, or indirectly, from the VCF::Model class. In our case we'll derive from the 
	VCF::AbstractModel, which provides some basic implementation of the various virtual
	methods of a Model.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class CircleModel : public AbstractModel  {
... //rest of implemention omitted
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	Next we need to add support for emptying the model by implementing the Model::empty()
	method. We'll be sure to call the super class's implementation as well, so that the
	ModelChanged event is fired.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class CircleModel : public AbstractModel  {
... //rest of implemention omitted

	virtual void empty() {
		//remove all the circles!
		circles_.clear();

		//make sure to call the super class's implementation
		AbstractModel::empty();
	}
};
]]>		
	</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	At this point we have a our custom model almost ready to go. The one missing feature
	is the ability to notify others when our circle model changes, i.e. when a 
	circle shape is added or removed. To implement this we need to make some subtle changes
	to our implementation of CircleModel::addCircle() and CircleModel::removeCircle().
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class CircleModel : public AbstractModel  {
... //rest of implemention omitted

	enum {
		CircleAdded = Model::MODEL_LAST_EVENT + 100,
		CircleRemoved
	};
	
	
	void addCircle( const CircleShape& circle ) {
		circles_.push_back( circle );

		ModelEvent e( this, CircleModel::CircleAdded );
		ModelChanged.fireEvent( &e );
		updateAllViews();
	}
	
	void removeCircle( const CircleShape& circle ) {
		std::vector<CircleShape>::iterator found = std::find( circles_.begin(), circles_.end(), circle );
		if ( found != circles_.end() ) {

			circles_.erase( found );
			
			ModelEvent e( this, CircleModel::CircleRemoved );
			ModelChanged.fireEvent( &e );
			updateAllViews();
		}
	}
	
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	We have added a simple enumeration: a value for adding circles, anda value for 
	removing circles. This value becomes the model changed event's type when the 
	change occurs. This allows an event handle to distinguish what type of event occured.
	</para>
	<para>
	The extra code that was added in both the addCircle() and removeCircle() method
	simply creates and event and initializes it with reasonable values, and then
	fires the event on the ModelChanged delegate. This will notify any registered 
	event handlers. Then the Model::updateAllViews() method is called, which also 
	notifies all the views that are attached to this model. We can simplify this code a
	bit by changing it like so:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class CircleModel : public AbstractModel  {
... //rest of implemention omitted
	
	void addCircle( const CircleShape& circle ) {
		circles_.push_back( circle );

		ModelEvent e( this, CircleModel::CircleAdded );
		changed( &e );
	}
	
	void removeCircle( const CircleShape& circle ) {
		std::vector<CircleShape>::iterator found = std::find( circles_.begin(), circles_.end(), circle );
		if ( found != circles_.end() ) {

			circles_.erase( found );
			
			ModelEvent e( this, CircleModel::CircleRemoved );
			changed( &e );
		}
	}
};
]]>		
	</programlisting>
	Calling the Model::changed() method makes it a bit easier, and prevents 
	the implementer from forgetting to either fire the event on the delegate, 
	or notifying all the models views. At this point we know have a usable 
	model class.
	</para>
	<formalpara><title>Example 1</title>
	This will demonstrate probably the simplest usage of our model. We'll create a
	window, a model, and hook the two together.
	</formalpara>
	<para>
	First we'll define a custom Window class:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart1Window : public Window {
public:
	MVCBasicsPart1Window() {}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	This gives us our basic window. 
	<note>
	It's important to remember that a VCF::Window class is derived (indirectly)
	from VCF::Control. This means that a Window is also a specialized form of a view
	and we'll take advantage of this later on.
	</note>
	Next we'll fill in the constructor implementation. We will create an instance of 
	our CircleModel class, add three circle shapes, and add our window to the model.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart1Window : public Window {
public:
	MVCBasicsPart1Window() {
		setCaption( "MVCBasics Part 1" );
		setVisible( true );

		CircleModel* model = new CircleModel();

		model->addCircle( Point(100,200), 100 );
		model->addCircle( Point(234,550), 300 );
		model->addCircle( Point(300,400), 80 );
		
		model->addView( this );
	}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>	
	Note the call to the model's addView() passing in the window instance. This will 
	add the window as a view to the model. This in turn calls the view's setViewModel()
	method.
	</para>
	<para>
	At this point we have our window, we can create and also create a model for it.
	But we still need to be able to present the view, or draw it. For this, we'll 
	override the window's paint() method, and draw the model's content's as a series of
	circles.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart1Window : public Window {
public:
	...//rest of code ommitted
	virtual void paint( GraphicsContext* ctx ) {
		Window::paint( ctx );

		CircleModel* model = (CircleModel*)getViewModel();

		const std::vector<CircleShape>& circles = model->getCircles();
		for ( std::vector<CircleShape>::const_iterator it = circles.begin(); it!=circles.end(); it++ ) {
			const CircleShape& circle = *it;
			ctx->circle( circle.center_, circle.radius_ );
		}
		ctx->setColor( Color::getColor("black") );
		ctx->strokePath();
	}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	This calls the super class's paint() method first, then retrieve the model. Recall that
	in the constructor, we added the window to the model, which in turns sets the model
	on the view. We then iterate through each circle shape, and draw a circle on the 
	GraphicsContext.
	</para>
	
	<formalpara><title>Example 2</title>
	This next example will create a custom window, an instance of our CircleModel, 
	and a custom view instance, taking the functionality that was in our
	custom window's paint() method, and putting it in our custom view.
	</formalpara>
	<para>
	First we'll define our custom view class. We'll derive from AbstractView, which 
	provides a default implementation for most of the virtual methods
	of the View interface.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart2View : public AbstractView {
public:
	MVCBasicsPart2View(){}

	virtual void paintView( GraphicsContext* ctx ) {


		Control* control = AbstractView::getViewControl();

		Rect r = control->getClientBounds();

		ctx->rectangle( &r );
		ctx->setColor( Color::getColor("white") );
		ctx->fillPath();
		

		CircleModel* model = (CircleModel*)getViewModel();

		const std::vector<CircleShape>& circles = model->getCircles();
		for ( std::vector<CircleShape>::const_iterator it = circles.begin(); it!=circles.end(); it++ ) {
			const CircleShape& circle = *it;

			ctx->circle( circle.center_, circle.radius_ );

		}
		ctx->setColor( Color::getColor("black") );
		ctx->strokePath();
	}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	This is basically the same functionality that we had in our previous window's 
	paint() method. We only need to implement one method (all the others are already
	implemented by the AbstractView super class), paintView() which takes a 
	GraphicsContext pointer, just like the Window::paint() method does.
	</para>
	<para>
	Next we'll go ahead an implement our custom window class. This time all we need to 
	do is implement the constructor, where we'll create our model (just like we
	did last time) and also create our new view class instance.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart2Window : public Window {
public:
	MVCBasicsPart2Window() {
		setCaption( "MVCBasics Part 2" );
		setVisible( true );

		CircleModel* model = new CircleModel();

		model->addCircle( Point(100,200), 100 );
		model->addCircle( Point(234,550), 300 );
		model->addCircle( Point(300,400), 80 );

		View* view = new MVCBasicsPart2View();

		this->setView( view );
		model->addView( view );
	}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	We create our model and add circle shapes just like we did the last time. 
	Next we create our MVCBasicsPart2View view instance. Now we set the window's 
	view with a call to setView(), passing in our new view instance. Finally we 
	add our new view instance to the model. Note that we did <emphasis>not</emphasis>
	add the window instance as a view to the model. Also note that we did not 
	have to override the Window's paint() method, because we set a view for the 
	window, the window (or any control instance) will delegate the painting to be
	handled by the view.
	</para>
	
	<formalpara><title>Example 3</title>
	Our 3rd example will duplicate the functionality found in the previous example
	and also add the processing of user input. We will add event handlers for 
	processesing key up events, and mouse clicked events.
	</formalpara> 
	<para>
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart3Window : public Window {
public:
	MVCBasicsPart3Window() {
		setCaption( "MVCBasics Part 3" );
		setVisible( true );

		CircleModel* model = new CircleModel();

		model->addCircle( Point(100,200), 100 );
		model->addCircle( Point(234,550), 300 );
		model->addCircle( Point(300,400), 80 );

		View* view = new MVCBasicsPart2View();

		this->setView( view );
		model->addView( view );

		MouseClicked += 
			new MouseEventHandler<MVCBasicsPart3Window>( this, &MVCBasicsPart3Window::onMouseClicked, "MVCBasicsPart3Window::onMouseClicked" );

		KeyUp += 
			new KeyboardEventHandler<MVCBasicsPart3Window>( this, &MVCBasicsPart3Window::onKeyUp, "MVCBasicsPart3Window::onKeyUp" );
	}


	void onMouseClicked( MouseEvent* e ){}

	void onKeyUp( KeyboardEvent* e ) {}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>	
	The change, obviously, is the addition of event handlers. We add an event handler 
	(MVCBasicsPart3Window::onMouseClicked) to the window's MouseClicked delegate 
	and another handler (MVCBasicsPart3Window::onKeyUp) to the window's KeyUp
	delegate. Now let's see what we do for our implementation of MVCBasicsPart3Window::onKeyUp
	and MVCBasicsPart3Window::onMouseClicked.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart3Window : public Window {
public:
	...//rest of code ommitted

	void onMouseClicked( MouseEvent* e ){
		CircleModel* model = (CircleModel*)getView()->getViewModel();

		model->addCircle( *e->getPoint(), 50 );
	}

	void onKeyUp( KeyboardEvent* e ) {
		if ( e->getVirtualCode() == vkDelete ) {
			CircleModel* model = (CircleModel*)getView()->getViewModel();
			
			model->empty();
		}
	}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	When we click on the window we'll add a circle to the circle model. That's 
	all we ahve to do - the update to the window and the repainting will all happen
	automatically. When we get notified by the KeyUp delegate, if the 
	delete key was pressed, then we will empty the model, clearing the display.
	</para>
	
	<formalpara><title>Example 4</title>
	This example will do things a little differently. We won't derive a new Window
	class. Instead we'll create our own controller class which will handle the 
	mouse click and key up events. We will also add another type of view.
	</formalpara>
	
	<para>
	First we'll look at our new view, MVCBasicsPart4View. The difference is simply in the
	way the model is rendered.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MVCBasicsPart4View : public AbstractView {
public:
	virtual void paintView( GraphicsContext* ctx ) {
		Control* control = AbstractView::getViewControl();

		Rect r = control->getClientBounds();		

		ctx->rectangle( &r );
		ctx->setColor( Color::getColor("white") );
		ctx->fillPath();		

		CircleModel* model = (CircleModel*)getViewModel();

		const std::vector<CircleShape>& circles = model->getCircles();
		for ( std::vector<CircleShape>::const_iterator it = circles.begin(); it!=circles.end(); it++ ) {
			const CircleShape& circle = *it;
			
			ctx->setColor( Color::getColor("blue") );
			ctx->circle( circle.center_, circle.radius_ );
			ctx->fillPath();

			ctx->setColor( Color::getColor("black") );
			ctx->circle( circle.center_, circle.radius_ );
			ctx->strokePath();

		}	
		
		EtchedBorder bdr;
		bdr.setStyle( GraphicsContext::etSunken );
		bdr.paint( &r, ctx );
	}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	As we can see, in this view we first paint a solid white background, then render 
	each circle with a blue fill and a solid black outline. And finally we draw a 
	etched border around the client bounds of the control that "owns" this view.
	</para>
	<para>
	Next we'll look at the controller class. What we have done here, is simply to migrate the
	code that we had previously put in our custom window class, and push it into our new 
	controller class. First lets define our controller class:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MyMVCController : public Component {
public:
	CircleModel* model_;

	void onMouseClicked( MouseEvent* e );

	void onKeyUp( KeyboardEvent* e );
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	We're deriving from Component so that we can create an instance of our controller, and then 
	add it to some other Component instance, which will automatically delete it when the 
	owner component is deleted. We'll add a member variable that holds a pointer to the current
	model to work with, which we will set when we create the controller.
	</para>
	<para>
	Next we'll implement the onMouseClicked() and onKeyUp(). To do this, we just copy over 
	the code that was previously in our MVCBasicsPart3Window.
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
class MyMVCController : public Component {
public:

	CircleModel* model_;

	void onMouseClicked( MouseEvent* e ) {	

		if ( e->hasLeftButton() ) {
			model_->addCircle( *e->getPoint(), 50 );
		}
		else if ( e->hasRightButton() ) {

			const std::vector<CircleShape>& circles = model_->getCircles();

			std::vector<CircleShape>::const_iterator it = circles.begin();
			Rect r;
			while ( it != circles.end() ) {
				const CircleShape& shape = *it;
				r.left_ = shape.center_.x_ - shape.radius_;
				r.top_ = shape.center_.y_ - shape.radius_;
				r.right_ = shape.center_.x_ + shape.radius_;
				r.bottom_ = shape.center_.y_ + shape.radius_;

				if ( r.containsPt( e->getPoint() ) ) {
					model_->removeCircle( shape );
					break;
				}
				it ++;
			}
			
		}
	}

	void onKeyUp( KeyboardEvent* e ) {

		if ( e->getVirtualCode() == vkDelete ) {
			model_->empty();
		}
	}
};
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	The next big change is in how we hook all of this together. Lets look at the code in 
	our example4() function:
	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
void example4( VCF::Event* ) {
	Window* wnd = new Window();
	MyMVCController* controller = new MyMVCController();

	wnd->setCaption( "MVCBasics Part 4" );

	CircleModel* model = new CircleModel();

	model->addCircle( Point(100,200), 100 );
	model->addCircle( Point(234,550), 300 );
	model->addCircle( Point(300,400), 80 );		

	View* view = new MVCBasicsPart4View();

	wnd->setView( view );
	model->addView( view );

	wnd->MouseClicked += 
		new MouseEventHandler<MyMVCController>( controller, &MyMVCController::onMouseClicked, "MyMVCController::onMouseClicked" );

	wnd->KeyUp += 
		new KeyboardEventHandler<MyMVCController>( controller, &MyMVCController::onKeyUp, "MyMVCController::onKeyUp" );

	controller->model_ = model;

	wnd->addComponent( controller );
	wnd->show();
}
]]>	
	</programlisting>
	We create our window instance - note that we do <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to 
	derive a new window class. We create our controller, of type MyMVCController. 
	We then create our model and view. We set the window's view to our view instance,
	which will cause the view to be responsible for painting the window. We also add the
	view to our model instance. Next we add the the controller's onMouseClicked and 
	onKeyUp functions as event handlers to the window instance's MouseClicked, and 
	KeyUp delegates. Finally we set the controller's model pointer, and we add the controller
	to our window component list. When the window is destroyed, it will destroy all it's
	own component's, which in this case is the controller.
	</para>
	
	<formalpara><title>Example 5</title>
	Our last example will make a more complex UI. We will create 2 different views 
	of our our circle model. One will present the model as a series of circles, for a 
	graphical representation of the model. The second view will show the circle models
	state by displaying the number of shapes it currently has as well as the current 
	"action".
	</formalpara>
	<para>
	</para>
