HOWTO Setup CodeBlocks IDE with Borland Free Compiler and VCF

Requirements:
1. Borland Free Compiler (http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html#)
2. VCF (http://vcf-online.org/)
3. CodeBlocks IDE (http://www.codeblocks.org/)

Steps:

1. Install and setup Borland free compiler (for this and configuration refer to readme.txt supplied with VCF bcc makefiles)
2. Get latest VCF source snapshot and compile it.
3. Install CodeBlocks IDE (get one without mingw since you do not need it).
4. Open CodeBlocks IDE and Setup Borland compiler as default. You can do that by selecting menu command Settings/Compiler. 
5. In the same settings window on the tab page compiler there are another 3 tab subpages. Select one called #defines 
and enter these several defines:
WIN32
_MBCS
_RTLDLL
USE_FOUNDATIONKIT_DLL
USE_GRAPHICSKIT_DLL
USE_APPLICATIONKIT_DLL
USE_OPENGLKIT_DLL
USE_NETWORKKIT_DLL
USE_REMOTEOBJECTKIT_DLL
USE_INTERNETKIT_DLL

6. Now switch to linker tab and add these 3 libraries: import32, cw32mti, comctl32.
7. Now switch to Directories tab and on subpage compiler add include folder of compiler (default is C:\Borland\BCC55\Include) and add path to VCF include folder which is <VCF_FOLDER>\src.
8. Switch to subpage linker and add these folder in this exact order:
<Borland_compiler_folder>\Lib\PSDK
<Borland_compiler_folder>\Lib_patch
<Borland_compiler_folder>\Lib
<VCF_folder>\Lib

9. That is all for compiler default settings. 

Now create new project. You should allways use console application template. For an example code of generic VCF app take a look into VCF examples folder.
