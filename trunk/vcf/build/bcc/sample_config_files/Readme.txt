Here are supplied sample config files that represent propper configuration 
for both compiler and linker that will enable correct build of VCF.

For c++ Builder you should take a look into folder bcb.
bcb config files assume that you installed c++ builder c:\bcb6. If that is not the case replace c:\bcb6 part with your path (c:\Program Files\Borland... etc)

For Borland Free Compiler take a look into folder free_compiler.
free compiler config files assume that you installed free compiler in default location c:\Borland\BCC55. If that is not the case replace c:\Borland\BCC55 part with your path (c:\mypath\Borland... etc)

To install these files just copy them to <PATH OF Borland compiler>\bin.
