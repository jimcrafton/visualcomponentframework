   Tutorial 3</H1>
  <P>
   In this tutorial we'll cover the basics of events and how to add 
   support for them to our Employee class. For a more detailed 
   discussion of events see the <A HREF="Events_In_the_VCF.htm">Events</A> topic.</P>
  <P>
   Events happen when something changes in an object. When you click on 
   the close button of a window you fire off an event that closes the 
   window, and possible the application it represents. Events are 
   particularly useful because they allow other objects to be notified 
   when the event happens. This is a standard pattern in which an 
   observer is notified when an Event is fired in the object being 
   observed (formally this is known as the &quot;Observer&quot; pattern).</P>
  <P>
   Lets get a little more specific and talk about this is terms of our 
   Employee class. Lets say that when an Employee's age changes, then 
   the Employee fires off an Event. Just firing off the event is 
   meaningless unless we actually have something to fire off the event 
   to, in other words, a list of observers that are interested in 
   knowing that the Employee's age has changed.<BR>
