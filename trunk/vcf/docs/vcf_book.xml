Revision 1.1.2.2  2003/03/26 04:29:23  ddiego
many changes to the Makefile so that it now supports all the docs, either in
plain html, HTML Help, or html munged for online usages. This includes

doxygen. Munging now includes pitching the html/body tags and altering
the href and img tags for usage online (thi has to happen to doxygen tags)

Revision 1.1.2.1  2003/03/13 02:34:40  ddiego
