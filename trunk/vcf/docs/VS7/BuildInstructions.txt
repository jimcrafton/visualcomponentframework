April 29, 2008, for the 0.9.8 release

Step 1: Get the right tools. I'm using VS 2005 Pro, VS 2005 SDK (has mshelp2 stuff), 
	          FAR HTML from Helpware, doxygen, docbook, and cygwin with xsltproc and make.
	          
Step 2: Create src docs
	1. Make sure you have right tools installed and have doxygen on path.
	2. Open vcf\docs\Makefile, and set path to HTML_HELP_COMPILER and 
	     XSL_DOCBOOK_DIR (I remove the quotes when using cygwin).
	3. Open vcf\docs\vcf.xsl, and change the hard-coded path to your docbook htmlhelp.xsl	(keep quotes)
	4. Open doxyfile_mshelp2 in doxywizard  and remove the devmain from title.
	5. cd to vcf\docs, and run make on Makefile on target mshelp2_doxy_hh
                      make -f Makefile mshelp2_doxy_hh
  6. Open .hhp file (in folder doxy_mshelp2_html) in FARHTML and convert to .HcX file (H2 Utilities --> Convert 1.x)
      - Output will be placed in subfolder VCFSrcDocs.X.X.X
  7. In the HxC Editor, open the TOC file (.HxT extension) and put toc under a master TOC heading "VCF Source Documentation". Do this!
  8. Compile this to .HxS in FARHTML. Compile to a single .HxS (no .HxL). (H2 Project Editor, choose .HxC just produced)
  Smile, 1/3 of the way there.
    
Step 3: Create VCF Book docs

  1. run make -f Makefile mshelp2_coredocs_hh
  2. Use FARHTML to convert .hhp to .HxC
  3. Use HxC Editor to open .HxC from above step, go to toc.HxT, and remove & symbols from approx. line 425 (what's this entries).
  4. Compile to .HxS file, but change output name to VCFBook.0.9.8.HxS, and do not produce a .HxI file.
  
  
Step 4: Pull the 2 .HxS files together into a new combined .HxS.
  1. Copy *.Hxs, *.HxC, *.HxF, *.HxK, and .HxT created in step 2 and copy to location of Step 3 files.
  2a. Run H2 Collection editor from Common Tasks pane. Give name VCFDocs.X.X.X, add 2 .HxS files to it.
       Choose Hierarcial style, and give top-level node name.
       OR
  2b. Run H2 Collection Editor Wizard, save as VCFDocs.0.9.8.HxC, add 2 .HxC from setp 2 and 3, use hierarchial style toc, give Visual Component Framework X.X.X master TOC, etc.
  3. Hope for the best. Needs a little tweaking.
