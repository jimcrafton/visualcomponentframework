      <h1><a name="TopicTitle">Documentation Standards</a></h1>
      <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>This will explain how to write documentation topic for the VCF. This is
      considered separate from properly commenting code for the code generated
      documentation.</p>
      <h3>File Naming Standards</h3>
      <p>All topics will be in standard html, and will end with the
      &quot;.html&quot; (please don't end them in &quot;.htm&quot;) file
      extension.</p>
      <p>All topics will have a file name that is the same as the topic title,
      in lowercase, and with spaces substituted by underscore characters
      (&quot;_&quot; ). Topics that are considered too long may be trimmed in
      the file name. For example a topic titled &quot;My Really Cool
      Controls&quot; would be named &quot;my_really_cool_controls.html&quot;.</p>
      <p>All documentation should be stored in the vcf/docs directory - no
      subdirectories please.</p>
      <h3>Topic Skeletons</h3>
      <p>Alls topics will be made up of several subsections which will be
      labeled and named in the html with standard names. There two main topic
      types which determine which sections are used: the simplest type is a
      simple topic, which contains an Introduction, and zero or more sub topics
      (the exact formats to use will be discussed shortly). The second topic
      type is the more complex documentation topic, and contains two main
      sections: a Functional Specification, and a Usage section, as well as
      several sub sections under the two main sections.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>Simple Topics</h4>
      <p>Simple topics must have an Introduction and it should be labeled
      &quot;Introduction&quot; and use the H1 style. Each subtopic below this
      should use the H3 style.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>Documentation Topic</h4>
      <p>Each Topic will be made up of a Functional Specification section and a
      Usage section. The Functional Specification will be labeled
      &quot;Functional Specification&quot; and use the H1 style, and it will
      have an HTML name called &quot;FunctionalSpecification&quot;. It will have
      four sub sections, each labeled &quot;Introduction&quot;,&nbsp;
      &quot;Interfaces&quot;, &quot;Classes&quot;, and &quot;Detailed
      Description&quot;. All of these four sub sections will have HTML names
      &quot;FS_Introduction&quot;, &quot;FS_Interfaces&quot;,
      &quot;FS_Classes&quot;, and &quot;FS_Description&quot;, respectively. Each
      should use the H3 style. The Introduction should have a brief paragraph or
      two explaining the general intent or functionality of the topic. The
      Interfaces subsection should list all the interface classes used by the
      topic (there may be none). The Classes subsection should list all the
      classes used by the topic (there may be none). The Detailed Description
      should go into more detail and nitty-gritty of explaining how things work.</p>
      <p>The Usage section will be labeled &quot;Usage&quot; and use the H1
      style, and it will have an HTML name of &quot;Usage&quot;. It will have
      four subsections, each labeled &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;Basic
      Usage&quot;, &quot;Advanced Usage&quot;, and &quot;Examples&quot;. All of
      these four sub sections will have HTML names &quot;U_Introduction&quot;,
      &quot;U_Basic&quot;, &quot;U_Advanced&quot;, &quot;U_Examples&quot;,
      respectively. Each should use the H3 style. The Introduction should have a
      brief paragraph or two explaining the usage at a high level. The Basic
      Usage should describe the most common or canonical usage. The Advanced
      Usage should describe how to use the topic in more advanced and complex
      ways, if applicable. The Examples should have some code sample further
      explaining how to use the topic.</p>
      <p>There are template files which exist to serve as a starting point when
      creating a new topic.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>[</p>
      <ul>
        <li>where the template files live</li>
        <li>Style considerations/standards</li>
        <li>Discuss any tools used for creating docs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>]</p>
