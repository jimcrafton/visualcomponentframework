              to check your work back in to the source tree. If you want an easy
              way to get the <i>very</i> latest code, and you don't want to wait
              till I put the next tgz file up, then CVS is also the way to go.
              However if you don't care about any of that then you can easily

                  code.

                  include .lib files as well as .exe, and .dll files. Libraries
                  for linking statically or dynamically are included.

                  prebuilt binaries for these
                <li>The current html help generated documentation, both of the

              There are a number of things that need to happen dynamically, and
              for that you need RTTI. In other words you need dynamic discovery
              at runtime, and I use the&nbsp; <b>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;</b>&nbsp;
              function to help with this since it already built in to the C++
              system.&nbsp;
              <p>I have tried to compile the VCF without RTTI (turning off
              support for the C++ language, and the additions of my own), and it
              seemed to make very little difference in memory foot print. So I
              think, but I'm not sure, that the size is due to the number of
              classes in the DLL.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The speed issue is bogus in my opinion. I have done tests in
              release testing the speed of dynamic casts with reinterpret casts<br>
              These times were obtained using classes that were relatively deep
              in the hierarchy&nbsp; (5 to 6 levels deep) and were obtained
              using the QueryPerformanceFrequency/QueryPerformanceCounter API,
              on a Windows 2000 box, Pentium 3 1Ghz CPU, 256 Mb RAMl, with VC++
              6 sp3.</p>
              <p>The times are in seconds and represent the time it take to
              perform a dynamic_cast vs. a reinterpret_cast in a release build.</p>

              like with the code. You do NOT have to submit changes back, you do
              NOT have to make your source that uses the VCF available, so it is
              completely appropriate for commercial, proprietary development. I
              am more concerned with people using the VCF than I am trying to
              force people to do this, that, or the other with their code.
              However, it would be nice, though it is NOT required, if you gave
              credit where credit is due, so I would certainly appreciate being
              mentioned somewhere noticeable if you do decide to use the VCF.</td>

              addition the VCF Builderk, which is the GUI &quot;IDE&quot; for
              creating applications using the VCF, will also run on these
              platforms since it is written entirely in the VCF.
              <p>Sadly, I do not get paid for this (though wouldn't it be
              wonderful if someday that could happen...). I am doing this
              because I believe there is a need for something like this in C++,
              and I have yet to see anything else out there that comes close to
              the breadth of what the VCF can/will accomplish (with the
