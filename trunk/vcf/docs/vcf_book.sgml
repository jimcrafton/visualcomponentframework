Revision 1.2  2003/05/17 20:36:55  ddiego
this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from
the devmain-0-6-0 branch plus a few minor bug fixes

Revision 1.1.2.3  2003/05/15 03:00:59  ddiego
added initial osx source( FoundationKit only),
plus some fixes to compile under GCC 3.x compilers

Revision 1.1.2.2  2003/03/26 04:29:23  ddiego
many changes to the Makefile so that it now supports all the docs, either in
plain html, HTML Help, or html munged for online usages. This includes
the docbook documentation AND the source documentation as generated by
doxygen. Munging now includes pitching the html/body tags and altering
the href and img tags for usage online (thi has to happen to doxygen tags)

Revision 1.1.2.1  2003/03/13 02:34:40  ddiego
added some more docs and broke apart the various "books" so they can be all
put together or in separate books. Made to changes to Makefile

				<question>
					<para>Why are you writing another framework ? Aren't there enough out there ?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>
					The Visual Component Framework (VCF) was designed to make application 
					programming in general, particularly applications with User Interfaces, 
					much easier than it currently is with typical development tools. In addition 
					it was created to be cross platform in design, so a program relying only 
					on features within the VCF should simply recompile on another platform 
					supported by the VCF.
