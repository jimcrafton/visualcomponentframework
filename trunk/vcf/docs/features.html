      <p>The VCF features an easy to use programming API and class hierarchy.
      Below is a list briefly describing the key features in the framework.</p>
      <h3>Features of the Visual Component Framework</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A rich class hierarchy for easily accomplishing your application's
          programming needs
        <li>Classes that cover the basic needs such as threading, files,
          streaming, error logging, traces, and common string utility functions.
        <li>Advanced RTTI features that allow for such things as dynamic object
          creation given a registered class name or a registered UUID string
          that represents the class, dynamic introspection of a given object's
          class and listing such data as the class name, super class, the
          properties of the class, member methods, and implemented interfaces.
        <li>Memory leak detection in debug mode for catching VCF::Object derived
          classes that have not been freed. This can be turned completely off in
          debug by recompiling the libraries
        <li>Standard event architecture that can be used in console applications
          as well as GUI based applications. Allows for connecting class member
          functions to events that another object (or objects) may fire off.
        <li>Graphics classes for easily drawing on a graphics context, as well
          as working with images. This include easily manipulating things like
          the current color, pen and brush attributes, and current
          transformation matrix
        <li>A simple image loading architecture that allows multiple formats to
          be registered for loading up a variety of different graphics formats.
          On Win32 systems the default image loading support is limited to
          &gt;BMP files, but by using the ImageFormats library (also a part of
          the VCF) a wide variety of additional image types are also supported.
          Currently the ImageFormats library uses <a href="http://www.6ixsoft.com">FreeImage</a>
          to support a image types such as .TIFF, .TGA, .PSD, .PNG, .PCX, .SGI,
          .MNG, .RAS, .PBM, .PPM. and many others.
        <li>More advanced classes for customizing the drawing process with
          application defined behaviors
        <li>A complete set of GUI classes, including a common set of base
          classes enabling advanced custom control creation. Some of the control
          classes include tree controls, list controls, check box and radio
          controls, push buttons, single line and multi line text controls, and
          many others.
        <li>A standard set of application classes for things like resources,
          loading windows or forms dynamically at application startup, saving of
          application state, a registry class for common storage of system and
          application information
        <li>Other application classes include a simple Undo/Redo architecture
          based on commands that allows for undoing and redoing commands as well
          as notifying other objects of the events
        <li>GUI controls that support both alignment and anchoring. Any control
          may be aligned to the top, bottom, left or right of it's parent
          container control.&nbsp; Alternately controls may use their anchoring
          properties to anchor themselves to the left, right, top and/or bottom
          sides of their parent container control.
        <li>The GUI provides a set of Model and View classes for using in MVC
          patterns. A series of models like the ListModel, TreeModel, and&nbsp;
          TextModel are used in controls to provide separation of the data from
          the UI presentation code. Because a View can be dynamically attached
          to a Control at runtime, it will be possible to develop
          &quot;themes&quot; in the future.
        <li>Because of the RTTI features and the event handlers, the VCF easily
          supports component programming. Objects can easily register event
          handlers with other object in the system at runtime, without knowing
          the specifics of each other.
        <li>As much as possible, VCF tries to be as flexible as possible,
          allowing you to use the parts you want, and allowing for
          interoperability with other frameworks. Thus VCF controls can be used
          inside of an MFC app if you like.
        <li>No need of special preprocessor tools - if you have a reasonably
          complete C++ compiler then you're all set to go.
        <li>Heavy use of the Standard Template Library throughout the VCF, as
          well as templates, that make up the RTTI extensions the VCF
          implements.
        <li>Ability to access the low level handles for most native objects. For
          example, by accessing the Thread's peer class, you can get a handle to
          the native thread handle itself. For a control, you can access the
          control's peer and get a handle id that represents the windowing
          systems native handle for a window/widget. This allows you to use
          platform specific calls when necessary.</li>
