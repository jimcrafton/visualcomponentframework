   Using the New Class Wizard</H1>
  <P>
   The Class Wizard can be used any time you would like to create a new 
   class that supports VCF compliant RTTI. In addition, you can specify 
   properties that</P>

   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   The &quot;Name&quot; <A NAME="NameField"></A>is the name of your class.</P>
  <P>
   The &quot;Derives from<A NAME="DerivesFrom"></A>:&quot; represent the 
   class to inherit from. The drop down list shows a possible set of 
   classes, but any class may be used so long as somewhere along the 
   line it inherits from VCF::Object. If you choose to derive from a 
   class that does <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">not</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">&nbsp;ultimately
    derive from VCF::Object, then you will not be able to use the 
   advance features of VCF Run Time Type Information (RTTI), such as 
   dynamic properties, dynamic super class discovery, etc.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   The Header<A NAME="HeaderField"></A> field represents the file name 
   of the classes header or .h file. It is disabled by default (where 
   the name of the .h file is the same as the class name), but can be 
   enabled by clicking on the button with the ellipsis label to the 
   right of the field. This will bring up a dialog allowing you to save 
   to a specific directory and/or file name.</P>
  <P>
   Browsing<A NAME="BrowseForHeader"></A> for a different directory for 
   the classes header file can done by clicking on the button with the 
   ellipsis label to the right of the field. This will bring up a dialog 
   allowing you to save to a specific directory and/or file name. The 
   header does not have to in the same directory as the implementation 
   file (.cpp).</P>
  <P>
   The CPP<A NAME="CPPField"></A> field represents the file name of the 
   class's implementation or .cpp file. It is disabled by default (where 
   the name of the .cpp file is the same as the class name), but can be 
   enabled by clicking on the button with the ellipsis label to the 
   right of the field. This will bring up a dialog allowing you to save 
   to a specific directory and/or file name.</P>
  <P>
   Browsing<A NAME="BrowseForCPP"></A> for a different directory for the 
   class's implementation file can done by clicking on the button with 
   the ellipsis label to the right of the field. This will bring up a 
   dialog allowing you to save to a specific directory and/or file name. 
   The implementation does not have to in the same directory as the 
   header file (.h).</P>
  <P>
   Checking &quot;Supports VCF RTTI&quot;<A NAME="SupportVCF_RTTI"></A> 
   allows your class to have access to the advanced <SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-weight : normal;">RTTI
    features of the VCF. If this is checked then the Class Wizard will 
   automatically generate the RTTI macros for you. All you have to do to 
   finish this is to register your class with the VCF ClassRegistry in 
   your start up code.</SPAN></P>
  <P>
   Checking &quot;Abstract Class&quot;<A NAME="AbstractClass"></A> marks 
   your class as an abstract class. An abstract class cannot be created 
   from a class name (unlike a normal class with VCF RTTI), but it can 
   have properties, a super class, and the other features of VCF RTTI.</P>
  <P>
   The Properties<A NAME="PropertiesList"></A> list shows all the 
   properties of the class. It allows you to add properties through the 
   Wizard, and allow it to generate the correct RTTI macros as well as 
   simple get and set methods for you. Adding additional properties 
   later on has to be done by hand, but is pretty simple once you have 
   the original examples to follow.</P>
  <P>
   Clicking &quot;OK&quot;<A NAME="OKBtn"></A> accepts your class 
   information and generates C++ code for you and automatically adds the 
   files to your currently active Visual Studio project.</P>
  <P>
   Clicking &quot;Cancel&quot;<A NAME="CancelBtn"></A> closes the Wizard 
   dialog without generating any code.</P>
