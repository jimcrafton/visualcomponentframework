      <h1><a name="TopicTitle">Understanding the VCF source directory tree</a></h1>
      <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>The VCF is organized into a series of subdirectories all under the main
      VCF root directory. All the core&nbsp; source code is contained in two top
      level directories, <i>include</i> (all the header files for the
      framework), and <i>src </i>(all the implementation files for the
      framework). Documentation is contained in the <i>docs</i> directory and
      consists of all the HTML and images necessary for creating the HTML Help
      files (on Win32 systems). Executable binaries are kept in the <i>bin</i>
      directory, while the link libraries are kept in the <i>lib </i>directory.</p>
      <p>The main header files in the <i>include</i> directory are used by each
      of the framework &quot;kits&quot; (FoundationKit, GraphicsKit,
      ApplicationKit, etc) to pull in whatever common files are needed by a
      developer using the particular kit and are named with the form &lt;kit
      name&gt;.h. For example, the <i>FoundationKit.h</i> header includes all
      the common headers required for developing with the VCF when using the
      FoundationKit. So a developer writing a console application that links to
      the FoundationKit simply needs to <code>#include &quot;FoundationKit.h&quot;</code>
      and everything else will be taken care of. If you are using pre compiled
      headers then you would want to include this file (<i>FoundationKit.h</i>)
      in your master pre compiled header file (i.e. if you are used to using
      VC++ you would put this include in your stdafx.h file). Kits that use the
      FoundationKit will also include the <i>FoundationKit.h</i> in their header
      as well. For example, the <i>ApplicationKit.h</i> includes the GraphicsKit.h
      header, which in turn includes the <i>FoundationKit.h</i>. Thus including
      the <i>ApplicationKit.h</i> pulls in the other two major kit headers.</p>
      <p>Underneath the main <i>include</i> directory there are a series of
      subdirectories containing the rest of the framework headers, with each
      subdirectory named according to the high level functionality of the
      headers it contains. The following is an alphabetical list of these
      subdirectories, with a brief comment on the functionality of the
      directory.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>com</i> - this holds several headers used ONLY on Win32 for COM
          implementation, needed mainly because the clipboard and drag-drop
          implementations are COM compliant, making interoperability with
          non-VCF application possible as far as clipboard and drag-drop goes.</li>
        <li><i>core</i> - this holds most of the common VCF headers for core VCF
          classes like the ClassRegistry, properties, controls, models,
          etc.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><i>dragdrop</i> - this contains the headers used for drag and drop
          in the VCF.</li>
        <li><i>events</i> - all of the event class headers are stored here, as
          well as the template headers for the various event handlers.</li>
        <li><i>exceptions</i> - this contains all the error messages and
          exception classes</li>
        <li><i>graphics</i> - this contains all the graphics headers for the VCF
          (not counting the implementation of platform specific peer classes)</li>
        <li><i>implementer</i> -&nbsp;contains all the peer interface classes.
          If you are writing code that needs a new peer class to be written for
          the VCF, this is where you would put the header.</li>
        <li><i>implementerKit</i> - this directory contains all the headers for
          various platform specific implementations of peer classes. For
          example, the VCF::ThreadPeer class has it's header in <i>include/implementer/ThreadPeer.h</i>,
          and it's Win32 implementation header is in this directory as <i>include/implementerKit/Win32Thread.h</i>.</li>
        <li><i>io</i> - this contains headers for various kinds of IO, typically
          classes that derive from the VCF::InputStream and VCF::OutputStream
          classes.</li>
        <li><i>net</i> - this contains headers for the various networking
          classes like VCF::Socket.</li>
        <li><i>utils</i> - this contains headers for various utility classes
          such as the VCF::StringUtils class, the thread and synchronization
          classes, the VCF::Registry class and others.</li>
        <li><i>remote</i> - this contains all the classes used in the
          RemoteObjectKit library.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Like the <i>include</i> directory, the <i>src</i> directory also has a
      set of subdirectories, that mirror the include subdirectories in both name
      and function. For more information about them please see the descriptions
      above, the only difference being that instead of containing header files
      the <i>src</i> subdirectories contain C++ implementation files.</p>
      <p>When writing code for the VCF itself (as opposed to simply using it in
      your application) you must use include guards both for the outer level of
      your header files, and for any cases that require you to inlude a header
      inside of another header. For example, the following code demonstrates
      writing a header with correct top level include guards :</p>
      <pre>
      //MyHeader.h
      #ifndef _MYHEADER_H__
      #define _MYHEADER_H__
      
	//rest of code goes here

      #endif //_MYHEADER_H__
      </pre>
      <p><b>NOTE</b>: The symbol for the #define has the following form which <b><i>MUST</i></b>
      be followed for VCF headers. Headers for your own use outside of the
      framework proper can any form you want. That form is:</p>
      <p><code>_&lt;name of the header in upper case - no breaks, underbars,
      etc&gt;_H__</code></p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p>You have added a new control control class to the VCF called LEDLabel.
      It's header is called <i>LEDLabel.h</i>, so it's include guard is <code>_LEDLABEL_H__</code></p>
      <p>If your code for the VCF needs to include other headers, then you must
      wrap the #include in an include guard as well. Once again if this is code
      for your application, then this does not apply, you can use it if you want
      to, but you are not obligated to. If you contribute code the framework
      itself then you <b><i>must</i></b> do this. The following example
      demonstrates this:</p>
      
      <pre>
      //MyHeader.h
      #ifndef _MYHEADER_H__
      #define _MYHEADER_H__
     
     	//this will include the ListModel header
	#ifndef _LISTMODEL_H__
		#include &quot;core/ListModel.h&quot;
	#endif//_LISTMODEL_H__

	//rest of code goes here

      #endif //_MYHEADER_H__
      </pre>


      <p>This may seem like an extra hassle (and it is) but for a framework this
      size this helps reduce compile time and makes it more efficient to use.</p>
