   Deriving your own classes</H1>
  <P>
   Most classes in the VCF can be safely derived from. Often you'll find 
   all you need is to derive from <CODE>VCF::Object</CODE>. If you think 
   your class will need to support the firing of events and the ability 
   of allowing other objects to respond to these events, then deriving 
   from <CODE>VCF::ObjectWithEvents</CODE> may be more appropriate. In 
   terms of size difference, <CODE>VCF::Object</CODE> requires 8 bytes 
   of memory, while <CODE>VCF::ObjectWithEvents</CODE> weighs in at 48 
   bytes. There are a variety of reasons for this, almost all relating 
   to event handling. For more information on this please see <A HREF="Events_In_the_VCF.htm">Events</A>.</P>
  <P>
   Classes that need to be visually displayed, such as controls, should 
   derive from the appropriate control class. For creating custom 
   controls from scratch a good starting point is the <CODE>VCF::CustomControl</CODE> 
   class. For more information on creating new components or controls 
   please see the <A HREF="What_to_derive_from.htm">Components</A> section.</P>
  <P>
   When creating custom event classes you will probably want to derive 
   from the VCF::Event class.
