   Deriving your own classes</H1>
  <P>
   Most classes in the VCF can be safely derived from. Often you'll find 
   all you need is to derive from VCF::Object. If you think your class 
   will need to support the firing of events and the ability of allowing 
   other objects to respond to these events, then deriving from 
   VCF::ObjectWithEvent may be more appropriate. In terms of size 
   difference, Object requires 8 bytes of memory, while ObjectWithEvents 
   weighs in at 48 bytes. There are a variety of reasons for this, 
   almost all relating to event handling. For more information on this 
   please see <A HREF="Events_In_the_VCF.htm">Events</A>.</P>
