   Introduction</H1>
  <P>
   Welcome to the Visual Component Framework !</P>
  <P>
   The Visual Component Framework was inspired by the ease of use of 
   environments like NeXTStep's Interface Builder, Java IDE's like 
   JBuilder, Visual J++, and Borland's Delphi and C++ Builder. I wanted 
   a generic C++ class framework I could use to build app's quickly and 
   visually (when designing UIs), as well as having the core of the 
   framework be as cross platform as possible. The Visual Component 
   Framework is an Open Source project, so feel free to grab and use it 
   if you think it might be useful. If you're really adventuresome you 
   can volunteer to help develop it, making it even better, especially 
   in tying it into the VC++ environment as an add-in.&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   The Visual Component Framework (VCF) is currently divided into three 
   DLL's, the FoundationKit, the GraphicsKit, and the ApplicationKit 
   (these are DLL's for the Win32 version only, obviously under Linux 
   these would be Shared Objects).</P>

  <P>
   Currently the framework is being developed under Windows 2000 and 
   works fine in NT4.0 (sp3). It was working under Windows 98 but this 
   has not been tested in a while.</P>

  <P>
   The current build works under Visual C++ 6.0, but should be workable 
   under other Windows compilers as well, especially the Borland C++ 5.x compiler.
