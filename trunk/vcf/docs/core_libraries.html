      <p>The VCF has several core libraries that make up the framework. These
      libraries are available for static or dynamic linking. The libraries are
      the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, ApplicationKit,
          NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit, and each will be briefly discussed
      below.</p>
      <p>The FoundationKit is the basic library upon which everything else is
      built. It supplies the base class for the whole framework (VCF::Object)
      and supplies features like the RTTI/introspection, Streaming, Threads and
      Synchronization, and Events. For applications that only need these
      services, then all you'll need to link with is the FoundationKit. You can
      use it by simply including <i>FoundationKit.h</i> in your application
      code.</p>
      <p>The GraphicsKit is the graphics library and has basic routines and
      classes for painting on the screen as well as support for Images and
      vector primitives. There are also a set of higher level classes to make
      writing advanced graphics shapes possible and very easy to work with. The
      GraphicsKit also has a mechanism that supports reading and writing various
      image formats, and can be extended at runtime. You can use it by simply
      including <i>GraphicsKit.h</i> in your application code, which will also
      include the FoundationKit as well.</p>
      <p>The ApplicationKit is the library used for writing GUI applications and
      it is based on the FoundationKit and GraphicsKit libraries. It contains features
      like Components, Controls, Model and View classes, Component persistence,
      Undo/Redo, Application services, Event loops, Tool tips, Timers, Scrolling
      and many others.&nbsp; You can add this support to your application by
      including the <i>ApplicationKit.h</i> (which in turn automatically
      includes <i>GraphicsKit.h</i> and <i>FoundationKit.h</i>) header. If you
      need to access common controls, like the Label, CommandButton,
      TreeControl, and others, you just include the <i>ControlsKit.h</i> header.
      For using the various Model and Item classes, you can just include the <i>ModelViewKit.h</i>.</p>
      <p>The NetworkKit contains support for basic networking based on sockets.
      Support for both TCP and UDP sockets is available. You can use it by
      simply including <i>NetworkKit.h</i> in your application code, which will
      also include the FoundationKit as well.</p>
      <p>The RemoteObjectKit is used to support distributed objects, allowing
      C++ objects to talk to each other in-process, cross-process, or even
      cross-machine. This library is uses both the FoundationKit and the
      NetworkKit. You can use it by simply including <i>RemoteObjectKit.h</i> in
      your application code, which will also include the FoundationKit and
      NetworkKit as well.</p>
