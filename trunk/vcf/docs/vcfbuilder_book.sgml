Revision 1.3  2003/05/18 23:09:37  ddiego
fixes some mistakes in the docs/Makefile and adds some extra documentation.

Revision 1.2  2003/05/17 20:36:55  ddiego
this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from
the devmain-0-6-0 branch plus a few minor bug fixes

Revision 1.1.2.3  2003/03/26 04:29:23  ddiego
many changes to the Makefile so that it now supports all the docs, either in
plain html, HTML Help, or html munged for online usages. This includes
the docbook documentation AND the source documentation as generated by
doxygen. Munging now includes pitching the html/body tags and altering
the href and img tags for usage online (thi has to happen to doxygen tags)

Revision 1.1.2.2  2003/03/13 02:34:40  ddiego
added some more docs and broke apart the various "books" so they can be all
put together or in separate books. Made to changes to Makefile

Revision 1.1.2.1  2003/03/12 22:43:06  ddiego
more xmake docs
