        Build Instructions for Win32</h4></div></div></div><p>This will briefly
  cover the basics of building the VCF binaries using Microsoft's Visual C++ IDE
  versions 6, 7, or 7.1. For more details on this please see the VCF
  documentation installed with MSDN, or view it online at <a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/" target="_blank">http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/</a>.
  Additional information is also provided for users of Intel's C/C++ compiler.
				</p><p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 6 IDE.
				</p><p>
				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc60/vcfAllProjects.dsw workspace. 
				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as 
				static .lib files and DLL projects. To build all the VCF libraries select 
				the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active project. Building this 
				project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
				ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries
				will be built as both static <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> DLL binaries. To build
				just the static libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To
				build all the libraries as DLL's, build the "vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.
				</p><p>
				There are several additional projects you can build as well for additional 
				features.
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

					</p><p>
					The ImageFormats project, which adds support for a wide variety of 
					image formats by using the <a href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">FreeImage 
					library</a>. Build this if you would like to add this support to your 
					project.
					</p><p>
					</p></li><li><p>
					</p><p>
					The Win32HTMLBrowser (and Win32HTMLBrowser_StaticLib) project, for an 
					HTML browser peer (currently implemented using the Internet Explorer 
					IWebBrowser COM interface, though experiments have been done 
					using the Gecko component from mozilla).  
					</p><p>
					</p></li></ul></div><p>
				The build will take a bit, so now would be a good time for coffee, tea, or 
				perhaps reading some Dostoevsky...
				</p><p>

				Once the build is finished you are ready to go ! All binaries will be put 
				in the vcf/bin directory when built.
				</p><p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 7.0 IDE.
				</p><p>
				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc70/vcfAllProjects_vc70.dsw workspace. 
				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as 
				static .lib files and DLL projects. Visual Studio should prompt
				you to convert the Visual C++ 6 projects into the new Visual Studio 7 
				format. Click the "Yes to All" option, and all the projects should then
				get converted. To build all the VCF libraries select 
				the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active project. Building this 
				project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
				ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries
				will be built as both static <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> DLL binaries. 
				To build just the static libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" 
				project. To build all the libraries as DLL's, build the 
				"vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.
				
				</p><p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 7.1 IDE.
				</p><p>

				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc71/vcfAllProjects_vc71.dsw workspace. 
				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as 
				static .lib files and DLL projects. Visual Studio should prompt
				you to convert the Visual C++ 6 projects into the new Visual Studio 7.1 
				format. Click the "Yes to All" option, and all the projects should then 
				get converted. 
				</p><p>
				To build all the VCF libraries select the "vcfAllLibs" project and make 
				it the active project. 
				</p><p>
                Building this project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
				ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries
				will be built as both static <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> DLL binaries. To build
				just the static libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To
				build all the libraries as DLL's, build the "vcfAllDynamicLibs" project. 
				After having built the VCF for the first time, you can
				typically open the vcf/build/vc71/vcfAllProjects_vc71.sln solution file 
				instead of the workspace file should you decide to rebuild any of the projects at 
				a later time.			
				</p><p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 6 using the Intel C/C++ compiler.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 7.0 IDE with the Intel C/C++ compiler installed.
				</p><p>

				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/icl7/vcfAllProjects_icl7.dsw workspace. 
				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as 
				static .lib files and DLL projects. To build all the VCF libraries select 
				the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active project. Building this 
				project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
				ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries
				will be built as both static <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> DLL binaries. To build
				just the static libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To
				build all the libraries as DLL's, build the "vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.
