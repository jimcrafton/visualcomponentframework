        Build Instructions for Win32</h4></div></div></div><p>This will briefly
  cover the basics of building the VCF binaries using Microsoft's Visual C++ IDE
  versions 6, 7, or 7.1. For more details on this please see the VCF
  documentation installed with MSDN, or view it online at <a href="http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/index.html" target="_blank">http://vcf-online.org/docs/ref_manual/</a>.
  Additional information is also provided for users of Intel's C/C++ compiler.
				</p><p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 6 IDE.
				</p><p>
				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc60/vcfAllProjects.dsw workspace. 
				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as 
				static .lib files and DLL projects. To build all the VCF libraries select 
				the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active project. Building this 
				project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
				ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries
				will be built as both static <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> DLL binaries. To build
				just the static libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To
				build all the libraries as DLL's, build the "vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.
				</p><p>
				There are several additional projects you can build as well for additional features.
				</p>
				<div class="itemizedlist">
				<ul type="disc"><li>
				<p>
					The ImageFormats project, which adds support for a wide variety of image 
					formats by using the paintlib library. Build this if you would like to add 
					this support to your project. Please note that the GraphicsKit has built in 
					support for PNG and JPEG image formats, including any native image formats. 
					Under Win32 this includes BMP and ICO formats.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					If you'd like support for Internet features check out the InternetKit. If 
					you need a web browsing control then look at the HTMLKit.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					If you need more advanced XML support than what's built into the 
					FoundationKit, then you should build the XMLKit, which is built on top 
					of libxml.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					For adding JavaScript support we have introduced the JavaScriptKit.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					If you need support for regualr expressions then please build the RegExKit.
					</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>
				The build will take a bit, so now would be a good time for coffee, tea, or 
				perhaps reading some Dostoevsky...
				</p><p>

				Once the build is finished you are ready to go ! All binaries will be put 
				in the vcf/bin directory when built.
				</p><p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 7.0 IDE.
				</p><p>
				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc70/vcfAllProjects_vc70.dsw workspace. 
				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as 
				static .lib files and DLL projects. Visual Studio should prompt
				you to convert the Visual C++ 6 projects into the new Visual Studio 7 
				format. Click the "Yes to All" option, and all the projects should then
				get converted. To build all the VCF libraries select 
				the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active project. Building this 
				project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
				ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries
				will be built as both static <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> DLL binaries. 
				To build just the static libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" 
				project. To build all the libraries as DLL's, build the 
				"vcfAllDynamicLibs" project.
				
				</p>
				<p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 7.1 IDE.
				</p><p>

				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc71/vcfAllProjects_vc71.dsw workspace. 
				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as 
				static .lib files and DLL projects. Visual Studio should prompt
				you to convert the Visual C++ 6 projects into the new Visual Studio 7.1 
				format. Click the "Yes to All" option, and all the projects should then 
				get converted. 
				</p><p>
				To build all the VCF libraries select the "vcfAllLibs" project and make 
				it the active project. 
				</p>
				<p>
                Building this project will automatically build the FoundationKit, GraphicsKit, 
				ApplicationKit, NetworkKit, and RemoteObjectKit. The libraries
				will be built as both static <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> DLL binaries. To build
				just the static libraries, build the "vcfAllStaticLibs" project. To
				build all the libraries as DLL's, build the "vcfAllDynamicLibs" project. 
				After having built the VCF for the first time, you can
				typically open the vcf/build/vc71/vcfAllProjects_vc71.sln solution file 
				instead of the workspace file should you decide to rebuild any of the projects at 
				a later time.			
				</p>
				<p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0.&nbsp;</b>
				The following section deals with building the VCF libraries using the Microsoft 
				Visual C++ 8.0 IDE (Visual Studio 2005), including the Express version.
				</p><p>
				To build the VCF open the vcf/build/vc80/vcfAllProjects_vc80.sln solution. This 
				solution has all the various framework projects, both as static .lib files and DLL 
				projects. 
				</p>
				<p>
				To build all the VCF libraries select the "vcfAllLibs" project and make it the active 
				project.

				This workspace has all the various framework projects, both as static .lib files and DLL 
				projects. Select the "All" target and make sure that the IDE is set to use the "GCC Compiler" 
				compiler, then choose "Build->Build workspace" to build the libraries. The dynamic libraries 
				(dll's) are placed in vcf\bin, and the dll import libraries and static libraries are placed 
				in vcf\lib.
