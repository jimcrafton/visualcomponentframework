Make sure you have Perl installed on your system. Don't use 
the Cygwin version, it causes problems. Try the latest version
from ActiveState at http://activestate.com/store/activeperl/download/
Once Perl is installed do the following:

Build the libraries (Release and Debug):

open a command prompt (CMD.EXE)
cd to openssl

nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak 

nmake -f ms\ntdlld.mak 

These will build release and debug builds of the OpenSSL libraries
and executables. Currently the kit just uses libeay32.dll or 
libeay32d.dll.

Binary files will be in openssl/out32/ and openssl/out32.dbg/

At this point you can open the appropriate project in your IDE 
and build as normal.

The patches at http://codefromthe70s.org/sslimprov.asp
have already been applied to the openssl-0.9.8e distribution's
files. The configure step has also been performed as well so 
there's no need to do this, though you can certainly do it
just to be safe, or if you decide to alter things.
