# visualcomponentframework

The Visual Component Framework is a cross platform C++ application framework that offers a modern, clean architecture. 
It is divided into three major libraries. The FoundationKit provides services such as file access, streams, threads, 
synchronization primitives, and advanced RTTI features. The GraphicsKit includes classes for working with both image 
and vector graphics, and has built in support for the Anti-Grain Graphics library. The ApplicationKit provides GUI 
controls, use of the Model-View-Control pattern, property and component editors, undo/redo support, drag-and-drop, 
clipboard services, application resources, and UI metrics and policy managers.
