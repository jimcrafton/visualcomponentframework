<h1>Visual Component Framework 0.6.4&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Readme</h2>
<p>
Hmm, it's been awhile since this got updated. 
Well this release features a whole slew of new bug fixes and new features, inlcuding
<ol>
  <li>
  
</ol>
</p>


<h1>Visual Component Framework 0.2.6&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Readme</h2>
<h3>Known issues:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>There may be path problems when trying to run executable that link with
    the VCF Runtime DLL's ( FoundationKit.dll, GraphicsKit.dll, and
    ApplicationKit.dll). These require a path variable called VCF_BIN to be
    added to your system PATH variable. The installer adds this to your user
    PATH but if this does not work then it will probably need to added to you
    local PATH. For this you'll need Administrator privileges. If you know of a
    better solution please contact <a href="mailto:ddiego@one.net">me</a>
    !&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add-ins sometimes do not get added automatically to Dev Studio. These can
    be added manually by clicking the &quot;Tools &gt; Customize...&quot; menu
    item and selecting the &quot;Add-ins and macro files&quot; tab page. Click
    on the &quot;Browse...&quot; button and look in the vcf\build\vc60\add-ins
    directory and then go to the specific add in project you want to add
    (generally VCFNewClassWiz\Release\VCFNewClassWiz.dll for now). Select the
    dll and click OK. The add-in will be plugged into Dev Studio for you. If
    there are no dlls then just build the add and repeat the previous
    steps.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>People experiencing any problems during or after the install should go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=6796&amp;atid=106796">VCF
Bugs</a> and submit a bug report.</p>
