		<h3>
			No conflicts between vc6 and vc7 (.NET)</h3>
		<p>
			It is possible now to compile the vcf files with both vc6 and vc7 without any 
			conflicts.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				The subdirectory [debug] and [release] and similar ones, where the subproducts 
				of the compilation are located, are now located under the directories [vc6] and 
				[vc7] of each project.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the sake of clarity, the libraries are located under the [vc60] and [vc70] 
				subdirectories of the [build] directory.
			</p>
			<p>
				The primary output have now the additional suffix _vc6 or _vc7.<br>
				For example bin/ApplicationKit_d.dll takes now the name 
				bin/ApplicationKit_vc6_d.dll if compiled under vc6
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>
			Automatic library selection</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				The libraries are automatically selected by using two macros BUILD_APPKIT_LIB 
				and USE_APPKIT_DLL<br>
				BUILD_APPKIT_LIB is only used when building the library (static or dynamic)<br>
				USE_APPKIT_DLL is only used when using the dynamic version of the library
			</p>
