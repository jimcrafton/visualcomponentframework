      <h1><a name="TopicTitle">Installing the VCF</a></h1>
      <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
        <p>You can install the VCF in a number of ways. The simplest way to
        install on a &quot;clean&quot; system, is to simply download the VCF
        Installer from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6796">here</a>,
        save to you hard drive, run the installer, and <i>Voila!</i> you are
        ready to rock and roll!</p>
        <p>The more complex way is to pull down the latest cvs tar.gz file
        (again you can get that from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6796">here</a>)
        and uncompress it somewhere on you hardrive. Once you have done this
        you'll need to set up some environment variables, which are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>VCF_BIN this should point to the bin under the root where you
            installed the VCF. For example, on my machine it resolves to
            &quot;d:\code\vcf\bin&quot;
          <li>VCF_INCLUDE this should point to the include directory under the
            same VCF root mentioned earlier. Once again (as an example), on my
            machine this resolves to &quot;d:\code\vcf\include&quot;
          <li>VCF_LIB this should point to the lib directory under the same VCF
            root mentioned earlier. Once again (as an example), on my machine
            this resolves to &quot;d:\code\vcf\lib&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have this done you can open up the projects in Microsoft
        Visual Studio and build the various workspaces (.dsw files).</p>
        <p>The most &quot;advanced&quot; way is to connect to cvs and pull down
        either the latest stable version or the latest development version.
        There are instructions on SourceForge detailing how to do this (some of
        these can be read <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=6796">here</a>).
        <b>Please take note</b>: if you download the VCF via anonymous CVS
        access, and then, realizing it is the greatest thing since sliced bread
        and toasted crumpets, you decide to join the project (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">hint,
        hint</a>), you will need to either wipe the directory where you
        currently have the VCF, or pull it down with cvs to a different
        directory. The problem that arises is that you will be unable to
        check-in anything, despite having joined the project and received write
        access to the cvs repository. I think this is because cvs thinks you are
        still &quot;anonymous&quot; and you have no write access for an
        anonymous user. Once you have pulled down the code with cvs repeat the
        steps above for environment variables.</p>
