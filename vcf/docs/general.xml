	<section><title>Features</title>
		<para>
		The VCF features an easy to use programming API and class hierarchy. Below
		 is a list briefly describing the key features in the framework.
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>
				Modern C++ design - use of modern C++ techniques like exceptions, 
				templates (where useful), name spaces, and heavy use of the Standard 
				Template Library.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Modular - built across several libraries as opposed to one huge 
				monolithic library that then becomes difficult to break apart. 
				This means that while the VCF is incredibly powerful as a framework 
				for writing GUI based applications, if you just want to use the 
				core features, such as threads, file IO, and RTTI you can do so, 
				without having dependencies on all the GUI code. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Support for Thread, Mutexes, Semaphores, Files, Streaming data, 
				error logging, string utility functions, and other basic services. 
				All of this is part of the FoundationKit and has no dependencies 
				on the graphics or UI code.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Advanced RTTI features that allow for such things as dynamic object 
				creation given a registered class name or a registered UUID string 
				that represents the class, dynamic introspection of a given object's 
				class and listing such data as the class name, super class, the 
				properties of the class, member methods, and implemented interfaces.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Memory leak detection in debug mode for catching VCF::Object derived 
				classes that have not been freed. This can be turned completely off 
				in debug by recompiling the libraries. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Easy to use and powerful event system, suitable for console as 
				well as GUI based applications. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Graphics classes for easily drawing on a graphics context, as well 
				as working with images. This includes easily manipulating things 
				like the current color, pen and brush attributes, and current 
				transformation matrix. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				A simple image-loading architecture that allows multiple formats 
				to be registered for loading up a variety of different graphics 
				formats. On Win32 systems the default image loading support is 
				limited to BMP files, but by using the ImageFormats library 
				(also a part of the VCF) a wide variety of additional image types 
				are also supported. Currently the ImageFormats library uses 
				<ulink url="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net">FreeImage</ulink> 
				to support image types such as .TIFF, .TGA, .PSD, .PNG, .PCX, 
				.SGI, .MNG, .RAS, .PBM, .PPM, and many others. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				More advanced classes for customizing the drawing process with 
				application defined behaviors. Advanced features also include 
				support for anti-aliased vector graphics through the use the 
				<ulink url="http://antigrain.com/">Anti Grain Graphics 
				libraries</ulink>.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				A complete set of powerful GUI classes, including a common set 
				of base classes enabling advanced custom control creation. Some 
				of the control classes include tree controls, list controls, check 
				box and radio controls, push buttons, single line and multi line 
				text controls, and many others. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				A standard set of application classes for things like resources, 
				loading windows or forms dynamically at application startup, 
				saving of application state, a registry class for common storage 
				of system and application information.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Other application classes include an Undo/Redo architecture based 
				on commands that allow for undoing and redoing commands as well 
				as notifying other objects of the events. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				GUI controls that support both alignment and anchoring. Any control 
				may be aligned to the top, bottom, left or right of it's parent 
				container control.  Alternately controls may use their anchoring 
				properties to anchor themselves to the left, right, top and/or 
				bottom sides of their parent container control. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				The GUI provides a set of Model and View classes for using in MVC 
				patterns. A series of models like the ListModel, TreeModel, and  
				TextModel are used in controls to provide separation of the data 
				from the UI presentation code. Because a View can be dynamically 
				attached to a Control at runtime, it will be possible to develop 
				"themes" in the future. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Because of the RTTI features and the event handlers, the VCF easily 
				supports component programming. Objects can easily register event 
				handlers with other objects in the system at runtime, without knowing 
				the specifics of each other.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				As much as possible, VCF tries to be as flexible as possible, allowing 
				you to use the parts you want, and allowing for interoperability with 
				other frameworks. Thus VCF controls can be used inside of an MFC app 
				if you like. 
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				No need of special preprocessor tools - if you have a reasonably 
				complete C++ compiler then you're all set to go.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Heavy use of the Standard Template Library throughout the VCF, as well 
				as templates, that make up the RTTI extensions the VCF implements.
				</para></listitem>
				
				<listitem><para>
				Ability to access the low level handles for most native objects. For 
				example, by accessing the Thread's peer class, you can get a handle 
				to the native thread handle itself. For a control, you can access 
				the control's peer and get a handle id that represents the windowing 
				systems native handle for a window/widget. This allows you to use 
				platform specific calls when neccessary.
				</para></listitem>

	<section><title>Downloading the VCF</title>
		<para>The VCF can be downloaded from the project's Sourceforge.net 
		<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6796">download site</ulink>. 
		Further details for your platform are given in the next section.

	</section>

	<section><title>Required Tools</title>
		<para>
		These are the required tools if you want to build the VCF.
		</para>
		<para>
		The tools you need depend on the platform you plan to work on, in the 
		following list.
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Win32</para>
				<para>
					For this platform the preferred compiler is currently the Microsoft 
					Visual C++ 6 compiler with Service Pack 5 applied. Microft Visual C++ 7 
					also works great, but some settings may be slightly different or found in 
					different places than described in the documentation.
				</para>
				<para>
					Currently, the supported compilers for the Win32 platform are:
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							Microsoft Visual C++ 6 (service pack 5 or better preferred).
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 (Including the Express edition).
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							Intels C/C++ compiler version 7 (using Visual Studio 6).
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							Borland C++ 6
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							MinGW-GCC compiler with the Code::Blocks IDE
						</listitem>						
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>MacOSX</para>
				<para>The MacOSX port currently uses the Apple Developer Tools that 
				come with OSX. The supported OS versions are:
				<itemizedlist>						
					<listitem>
						Mac OSX 10.3, using XCode 1.x.
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						Mac OSX 10.4, using XCode 2.x.
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				Mac OSX 10.2 is currently not supported at the moment, and the Project
				Builder files should be ignored, since Project Builder support has 
				been dropped by Apple in favor of XCode.
				</para>
					
			</listitem>
			
			<listitem>
				<para>Linux</para>
				<para>
					The linux port requires the GCC toolchain be installed in order 
					to build the VCF from source. The VCF has been found to compile 
					with versions of GCC including 2.95, 3.1, 3.2, and the 
					3.3 release (3.3 is reccommended). In addition, the GraphicsKit 
					and ApplicationKit require the presence of GTK 2.x shared libraries 
					and headers and whatever dependencies that entails.
				</para>

	<section><title>Installing the VCF</title>
		<section><title>For Win32 systems</title>
		<formalpara><title>Using the VCF Installer</title>
		You can install the VCF in a number of ways. The simplest way to install on a 
		"clean" system, is to simply download the VCF Installer from 
		<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6796">Source Forge</ulink>, 
		save the appropriate file to your hard drive, run it, and Voila! you are ready to 
		rock and roll! 
		</formalpara>		
		<formalpara><title>Install from a source archive</title>
		The more complex way is to pull down the latest cvs tar.gz file (again, you can 
		get that from 
		<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6796">Source Forge</ulink>) 
		and uncompress it somewhere on you hardrive. Once you have done this you'll need 
		to set up some environment variables, which are as follows: 
		</formalpara>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
				VCF_BIN : this should point to the bin under the root where you installed the 
				VCF. For example, on my machine it resolves to "d:\code\vcf\bin". 
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				VCF_INCLUDE : this should point to the include directory under the same VCF 
				root mentioned earlier. Once again (as an example), on my machine this 
				resolves to "d:\code\vcf\src".
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				VCF_LIB : this should point to the lib directory under the same VCF root 
				mentioned earlier. Once again (as an example), on my machine this resolves 
				to "d:\code\vcf\lib". 
			</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
		Once you have this done you can open up the projects in Microsoft Visual Studio and build 
		the various workspaces (.dsw files).
		</para>
		
		
		<formalpara><title>Install via CVS access</title>
		The most "advanced" way is to connect to cvs and pull down either the latest stable 
		version or the latest development version. There are instructions on SourceForge 
		detailing <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=6796">how to do this</ulink>. 
		<note><title>Anonymous vs. developer cvs access</title>
			<para>
			if you download the VCF via anonymous CVS access, and then, realizing it is the 
			greatest thing since sliced bread and toasted crumpets, you decide to join the 
			project (hint, hint), you will need to either delete the directory where you 
			currently have the VCF, or pull it down with cvs to a different directory.
			</para>
			<para>
			The problem that arises is that you will be unable to check-in anything, despite 
			having joined the project and received write access to the cvs repository. I 
			think this is because cvs thinks you are still "anonymous" and you have no write 
			access for an anonymous user. 
			</para>
		</note>
		</formalpara>
		<para>
		Once you have pulled down the code with cvs repeat the steps above for environment 
		variables.
		</para>
		</section>
		<section><title>For Mac OSX systems</title>
		<para>
		Currently you need to connect to cvs and pull down either the latest 
		stable version or the latest development version. There are instructions on 
		SourceForge detailing <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=6796">
		how to do this</ulink>. 		
		</para>
		</section>
		<section><title>For Linux systems</title>
		Pull down the latest tar.gz source file and unzip in the directory of you choice.
		</section>
		
		<section><title>Third Party Libraries</title>
		<para>
		In general you don't need to worry about installing any third party libraries,
		as the VCF comes with all the code you need, including third party libraries 
		that it makes use of. However, this section will discuss those third party libraries
		that, due perhaps to the size of the library, are not included in the main VCF
		code base.
		</para>
		<section><title>Open SSL on Win32</title>
		  <para>
		  Currently this is NOT needed! Please ignore these instructions for now.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  You can get the latest version of SSL from 
		  http://www.openssl.org/source/, and the most recent version is currently 
		  openssl-0.9.7b, but this will obviously change over time.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  OpenSSL does not use VC workspaces or project files, and unless you want to
		  find some existing binary installer, you'll need to install it from source.
		  To do this you'll need perl installed on your system, as the OpenSSL build scripts
		  make use of perl to do their work. If you have a version of perl as a result 
		  of an existing cygwin installation, do <emphasis>not</emphasis> use this version
		  unless you plan to completely build from the cygwin prompt and create a GCC
		  based version of the library. These instructions are for building a version of 
		  the library using Microsoft's VC++.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  With that in mind, get the latest perl from ActiveState at 
		  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/. They have an excellent
		  installer that will install Perl in a jiffy with no hassle.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  OpenSSL has some parts of the library that are coded using optimized assembler,
		  but to make use of this, you'll need Microsoft's MASM tool installed. This may 
		  or may not already be on your machine, look for an executable called "ml.exe"
		  in the "bin" directory of the main VC++ directory. If this is not there, you can
		  download it here:
		  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/tools/ppack/default.aspx
		  for free. If that link is not working, you may be able to find more information 
		  here http://users.easystreet.com/jkirwan/new/pctools.html that provides links
		  to versions of MASM. Please note that you do <emphasis>not</emphasis> have to
		  get MASM, you can build OpenSLL just without it, but the performance may be slightly
		  slower than if you used the assembly version of the some of the routines.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  Once you have your tools installed, open a command prompt, and navigate to the 
		  bin directory fo your version of VC++. For example, if you installed to the default
		  location and you're using VC6, then this would be 
		  "C:\Program Files\Visual Studio\VC98\Bin". For Visual C++ 7.1, it might be
		  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\bin" and so forth. Once 
		  there run the the vcvars32.bat file to initialize your path to point to the
		  right place for the compiler, linker, etc tools.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  In the same shell, cd to the directory that you installed OpenSSL to, for example
		  "c:\openssl-0.9.8a\". Now configure it for VC++ by typing:
		  <programlisting>
		  <![CDATA[
perl Configure VC-WIN32
		  ]]>
		  </programlisting>
		  You should see something like this when its done:
		  <programlisting>

		  </programlisting>
		  You're now ready to start the actual makefile based build process. You 
		  can choose to build a static or DLL version of the libraries. For a 
		  static build (i.e. a build that you'll statically link to) you'll
		  use the ms\nt.mak file, and for a DLL build you'll use the ms\ntdll.mak
		  file.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  To begin a static lib build, type:
		  <programlisting>
nmake -f ms\nt.mak

		  You should see a whole bunch of output stream by. You'll find the final

		  building the DLL version of the library. If you do this, the DLL
		  binaries will be in .\out32dll\.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  To make use of the library you'll need to link to it. The libraries
		  are obviously in the out32 directory, and the include files are in 
		  the .\inc32\ directory.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  If you want to build for a different version of VC++ make
		  <emphasis>sure</emphasis> to clean the old object code/binaries out
		  first! Otherwise you'll get all sorts of compiler errors

			<section><title>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 8.0 (including Express edition)</title>				
				<para>
				Till Novemeber of 2006 Microsoft is giving away it's Express edition of 
				Visual C++ 2005. This is a superb IDE for the Windows environment, and I'd 
				urge anyone on a budget to look into it. While it does not come with either
				ATL or MFC support this is OK, because the VCF gives you everything you'll
				need for GUI development on Windows, and VC 2005 gives you a great IDE! 
				The following section will address how to get it, and how to set it up
				for Windows GUI development, as there are a few special files you need 
				to adjust by hand.
				</para>
				<para>
					You can currently download the Visual C++ Express edition from the 
					<ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/download/">
						Visual C++ Express Edition Download site
					</ulink>.
					Follow the instructions there to install the software. Once VC 2005 is 
					installed you will need to install a recent version of the <ulink 
						url="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&amp;displaylang=en"> 
					Win32 Platform SDK</ulink>. Older versions as far back as the November 2001
					SDK work just fine if you have an older copy and don't want or need the 
					absolute latest and greatest from Microsoft.					
				</para>
				<para>
					Once you've installed the SDK, you need to adjust your settings in VC 2005
					to reflect this, so it knows to use the SDK files. You <emphasis>must</emphasis>
					follow these instructions, or things will not work correctly. You can read them at
					<ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/">Using 
					Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition with the Microsoft Platform SDK</ulink>. In case
					this link ever goes away or changes I'll summarize below:
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							Go to Tools > Options. Select the "VC++ Directories" section under
							"Projects and Solutions". In the "Show Directories for" drop down,
							select the following:
							<itemizedlist>
								<listitem>
									For "Executable files", add the [Path to SDK]\Bin directory.
								</listitem>
								<listitem>
									For "Include files", add the [Path to SDK]\Include directory.
								</listitem>
								<listitem>
									For "Library files", add the [Path to SDK]\Lib directory.
								</listitem>
							</itemizedlist>	
							These probably need to be the first items, but it seems to work OK if 
							they are not. Older version of VC++ required the SDK files to be included
							first, but VC2005 doesn't seem as picky.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							Find the file "corewin_express.vsprops". This should be in a directory
							like "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCProjectDefaults",
							or wherever you installed VC 2005 to. Edit this file so that
							<programlisting>
AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib"
							</programlisting>
							becomes 
							<programlisting>
AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib 
comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib"
							</programlisting>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							Edit the "AppSettings.htm" file. You should be able to find this
							in a directory like this "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\
							VC\VCWizards\AppWiz\Generic\Application\html\1033\". Comment out lines 
							441-444. 
						</listitem>	
					</itemizedlist>
					I'd like to thank Brian Johnson for writing the original instructions explaining
					how to do this.
				</para>

						<note>
							Due to restrictions on the free commandline compiler, there is no support
							for the HTMLBrowser control due to dependencies on Microsoft's ATL
							library. This is being addressed so that in the near future this will
							no longer be an issue.
						</note>
						For more information regarding the build instructions for Borland compilers,
						see the notes in the readme.txt file in vcf/build/bcc/readme.txt.
					</para>				
				<para>
				There are some missing libs that did not get distributed with the Borland 
				compiler install. These are found in the vcf/build/bcc/missing_libs directory.
				Copy them either to your &lt;PATH_TO_BCB_INST&gt;\Lib directory  or the vcf/lib 
				directory.
				</para>
				<para>
				Make sure that the bcc32.cfg file is correctly set up. You should have some 
				thing like this (assuming you have installed you compiler in "c:\bcb6", if 
				not replace as neccessary):
				<programlisting>
				<![CDATA[
-I"C:\bcb6\Include";"C:\bcb6\Include\vcl";"C:\bcb6\Include\Atl"
-L"C:\bcb6\lib\PSDK";"C:\bcb6\lib";"C:\bcb6\lib\obj";"C:\bcb6\lib\release"
]]>
				</programlisting>
				The order of the folders is important. Especially for linker folders. So 
				copy them as shown here.
				</para>
				For the Borland Free compiler the bcc32.cfg file should look like this:
				<programlisting>
				<![CDATA[
-I"C:\Borland\BCC55\Include"
-L"C:\Borland\BCC55\lib\PSDK";"C:\Borland\BCC55\lib"
]]>
				</programlisting>
				Of course replace the "C:\bcb6\" or "C:\Borland\BCC55" part with the 
				appropriate path where you installed the Borland Free compiler.
				<para>
				Make sure you setup environment variables for VCF_BIN, VCF_INCLUDE 
				and VCF_LIB. Without that you can not build and use them. See "Installing 
				the VCF" for more information about how to do this.
				</para>
				<para>
				Once this is done, you're ready to start issuing make commands. Open 
				up a command prompt and and issue a make command like so:
				<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
cd <PATH_TO_VCF>\build\bcc
make -fvcfAllLibs.mak
]]>
				</programlisting>
				This will build all dynamic and static libs. If for some reason name of your 
				make util is not make.exe open vcfAllLibs.mak and change MK variable to 
				the name of your make util. Do the same thing in vcfAllDynStatLibs.mak.
				</para>
				<para>
				It's possible to build specific libraries if you don't want (or need) to build everything.

				This way we avoid dependency on ATL and make complete library

				<para>
				To use the Borland IDE project files you need to create a subfolder lib_patch
				in your CBuilder root folder. In there copy c0x32.obj from &lt;CBuilder root&gt;\Lib 
				folder and rename it to c0w32.obj. Here is a more detailed explanation why this 
				was needed (from the VCF forum):
				<blockquote>				
					<para>
					After quite some time I managed to create set of IDE project files for building 
					VCF examples in BCB 5. Examples excluded in this release are:
					<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
					QTPlayer - This example uses QuickTime SDK that only works with visual C++.
					All lib files and headers are only MSVC compatibile. If somebody 
					makes a port of this to BCB than this sample could be ported.
					</listitem>				
					
					<listitem>
					TexLabel - Can not be compiled with BCB 5. Works only with BCB 6.
					</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
					</para>
					<para>
					Here is one important note about building these samples.
					</para>
					<para>
					Unfortunately in BCB project file it is not possible to specify custom startup object file. 
					That is necessary with VCF because every example has main procedure. Unfortunately 
					BCB project with windows application forces linkage of c0w32.obj that is startup file 
					that requires winmain procedure. What we need instead is c0x32.obj - startup file that 
					uses main procedure.
					</para>
					<para>
					The only way I found to trick BCB to use different object file than standard was to 
					create new folder in BCB root folder and copy there c0x32.obj and rename it to 
					c0w32.obj. After that every IDE project file must have this folder placed first in a 
					list of folders with lib files (Project\Options\Directories/Conditionals - line "Library 
					path").
					</para>
					<para>
					All example project files assume that path of this folder is $(BCB)\lib_patch.
					</para>
				</blockquote>
				</para>
				<para>
				So create folder lib_patch in the root of BCB installation and copy/rename mentioned 
				startup object file. This trick is needed only for windows applications. For console 
				applications it is enough to create standard console project in BCB.
				</para>
				<para>
				In every folder for an example there are two project files - &lt;projectname&gt;_bcb5.bpr 
				and &lt;projectname&gt;_bcb5_d.bpr . The first one is for a release build and 
				the other is for a debug build. In the &lt;VCFROOT&gt;\Examples folder there are 
				project group files Examples_bcb5.bpg (release projects) and Examples_bcb5_debug.bpg 
				(debug projects).
				</para>

				<section><title>MinGW-GCC compiler with the Code::Blocks IDE</title>
					<para>
						This section describes building the VCF + examples in the Code::Blocks IDE (
						<ulink url="http://www.codeblocks.org/">codeblocks.org</ulink>). The VCF has 
						only been tested with the more recent "Nightly Build" versions of the C::B IDE 
						(download info at their forum page at 
						<ulink url="http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php">forums.codeblocks.org</ulink>). 
						While version 1.0 RC2 might work, we have had troubles with precompiled header 
						support, and strongly recommend the current	Nightly Builds or newer.  See instruction 
						at the C::B site for using their IDE. The VCF codeblocks projects are known to work 
						versions 3.4.4 and 3.4.5 of the MinGW-GCC compiler. The VCF projects will not work with 3.4.2 or older.
					</para>				
				<para>There are several different Code::Blocks (C::B) workspaces you can use to build the 
				VCF, depending on whether you want to build dynamic libraries, static libraries, or both. 
				Building example VCF apps is also covered. These workspaces are found in the 
				vcf\build\codeblocks directory.
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>

				</itemizedlist>
				</para>
				<para>
				Open the workspace of your choice in the C::B IDE. Available targets include "mingw_Release", 
				"mingw_Debug", or "All" for both Release and Debug versions. Select the targer of your choice 
				(or use the default target of All), make sure that the IDE is set to use the "GCC Compiler" 
				compiler, and choose "Build->Build workspace" to build the libraries (+/- examples). The dynamic 
				libraries (dll's) are placed in vcf\bin, and the dll import libraries and static libraries are placed in 
				vcf\lib. All library names will have the suffix "_mgcc" added to their names to indicate they were built with 
				the MinGW-GCC toolchain. 
				</para>	
				<para>
				Building your own apps: The C::B IDE does not provide a great mechanism/wizard for creating an app skeleton, 
				though it does provide a nice generic template mechanism. To start building your own VCF apps, we recommend 
				opening one of the VCF example projects (such as HellowWorld), and saving it as a new project. This will give 
				you an application outline with compiler options set up correctly, and you can add and remove your source files 
				to the project as desired. You can also save an example project using "Project->Save project as user-template" 
				and then create new projects from that template. This works well, but in both of these cases you have to change 
				the name of the output binary through Project->Properties to your application output name.

				directory. The directory contains several make files for different compilers 
				that can be used from a command line.
				</para>
				<para>
				To build the whole VCF you need exactly one of the following make files:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
					GNUmakefile - GNU make + GCC
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
					makefile.bcc - Borland make + BCC
					</listitem>

					</listitem>
					<listitem>
					makefile.vc - MS nmake + MSVC
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				</para>
				<para>

				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
					GNU make
					<screen>
make -f GNUmakefile

				<para>
				If you want to build VCF under your VS7.0, VS7.1 or VS8.0 you just

				<section><title>Building Examples</title>
				<para>
				Each example has its own baked make file, a name of which is the 
				same as the main make file name. A command to build an example 
				has to be the same as to build VCF. Run a make utility in example's 
				directory to build the example separately. Run a make utility in 
				the "examples" directory to build all the examples.
				</para>
				<para>
				Note, an example will be built only if a kit that this example uses 
				enabled by setting an appropriate option.

				<section><title>Using bakefiles in your own project</title>
					<para>
					The easiest approach to create a make file or a VS6 project for 
					your own project using the VCF offers is to use bakefiles. Lets look 
					at the simplest way to start your own VCF project from scratch using 
					your favorite editor.
					</para>

					<para>
					Say, you created your own helloworld.cpp:
					<programlisting>
#include "vcf/FoundationKit/FoundationKit.h"

using namespace VCF;

int main( int argc, char** argv )
{
	FoundationKit::init( argc, argv );

	System::println( "Hello world!" );

	FoundationKit::terminate();
	return 0;
}
					</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
					You would like to test it and want to create a make file as easy
					and as quickly as possible. Create a text file helloworld.bkl as
					follows:
					<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<makefile>
	<include file="VCFHelper.bkl"/>

	<exe id="helloworld" template="vcf_exe_console">
		<sources>helloworld.cpp</sources>
		<vcf-use-FoundationKit/>
	</exe>
</makefile>
			]]>
					</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
					That is all. You are ready to generate a make file or a VS6
					project. Suppose you want to generate a VS6 project. You just
					need to run the following command from a command line:
					<screen>
bakefile -I"%VCF_DIR%\build\bakefiles" -f msvc6prj helloworld.bkl
					</screen>
					This command will generate helloworld.dsp and helloworld.dsw.
					</para>

					<para>
					If you prefer to generate a make file just run one of the
					following commands. Which of them is yours depends on what the
					compiler you prefer.
					</para>

					<para>
					This command will generate makefile.vc.
					<screen>
bakefile -I"%VCF_DIR%\build\bakefiles" -f msvc helloworld.bkl
					</screen>
					</para>

					<para>
					This command will generate makefile.gcc.
					<screen>
bakefile -I"%VCF_DIR%\build\bakefiles" -f mingw helloworld.bkl
					</screen>
					</para>

					<para>
					This command will generate makefile.bcc.
					<screen>
bakefile -I"%VCF_DIR%\build\bakefiles" -f borland helloworld.bkl
					</screen>
					</para>

					<para>
					This command will generate GNUmakefile.
					<screen>
bakefile -I"%VCF_DIR%\build\bakefiles" -f gnu helloworld.bkl
					</screen>
					</para>

					<para>
					As you can see there are different formats (-f parameter) only.
					There are the following assignments between formats and
					compilers.
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
						msvc - MS VC
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
						mingw - MinGW/GCC
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
						borland - Borland C++ compiler
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
						gnu - GCC
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
					The first three are Windows specific. The last one means a
					unix-style make file that can be used on Linux, Cygwin and Mac OS
					X.
					</para>

					<para>
					Once you execute the bakefile utility as it is described above
					you will get a make file. Or you will get several make files, if
					you generate them for different formats. Anyway, one of the
					following command will build an executable for you:
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
						GNU make
						<screen>
make -f GNUmakefile
						</screen>
						</listitem>
						
						<listitem>
						Borland make
						<screen>
make -f makefile.bcc
						</screen>
						</listitem>
						
						<listitem>
						MinGW make
						<screen>
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc
						</screen>
						</listitem>
						
						<listitem>
						MS nmake
						<screen>
nmake -f makefile.vc
						</screen>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
					</para>

					<para>
					Let us look at the helloworld.bkl closer. It is an XML file.
					There are two tags &lt;include&gt; and &lt;exe&gt;. The first one includes
					the VCFHelper.bkl file that has to be included by any user
					project:
					<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
<include file="VCFHelper.bkl"/>
			]]>
					</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
					The &lt;exe&gt; tag defines an executable. It is a console VCF
					application that has the only source file helloworld.cpp and uses
					the FoundationKit:
					<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
<exe id="helloworld" template="vcf_exe_console">
	<sources>helloworld.cpp</sources>
	<vcf-use-FoundationKit/>
</exe>
			]]>
					</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
					Suppose you created a GUI application that uses the ApplicationKit like this.
					<programlisting>
#include "vcf/ApplicationKit/ApplicationKit.h"

using namespace VCF;

int main( int argc, char** argv )
{
	Application* app = new Application(argc,argv);

	Window* mainWindow = new Window();
	app->setMainWindow( mainWindow );
	mainWindow->setCaption( "Hello World" );
	mainWindow->show();

	Application::main();

	return 0;
}
					</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
					Of course, you need to modify your bakefile as follows.
					<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<makefile>
	<include file="VCFHelper.bkl"/>

	<exe id="helloworld" template="vcf_exe_gui">
		<sources>helloworld.cpp</sources>
		<vcf-use-ApplicationKit/>
	</exe>
</makefile>
			]]>
					</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
					Please refer to the VCF examples to see how you can prepare a
					bakefile appropriate to your project. Each example directory
					contains a bakefile which can be used to learn the bakefiles
					features that are VCF specific. Please note, all the VCF examples
					include VCFCommon.bkl instead of VCFHelper.bkl. VCFCommon.bkl and
					VCFHelper.bkl are similar to each other. However, there is one
					difference. VCFCommon.bkl defines the bakefile variables that use
					the relative paths and can be used inside the VCF source tree
					only. VCFHelper.bkl defines the bakefile variables that use the
					system environment variable VCF_DIR and can be used outside of
					the VCF source tree. In other words, these are two different
					entry points: VCFCommon.bkl is for the internal use only;
					VCFHelper.bkl is to use in external custom projects.
					</para>

					<para>
					As you can see the first bakefile has the &lt;vcf-use-FoundationKit&gt;
					tag. The second bakefile has the &lt;vcf-use-ApplicationKit&gt; tag.
					For every kit there is a certain tag.
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
						&lt;vcf-use-FoundationKit&gt;
						</listitem>

						<listitem>
						&lt;vcf-use-GraphicsKit&gt;

					<para>
					The VCF contains some thirdparty libraries. You can use them in your
					project, so you might want to include an appropriate tag in your bakefile.
					For every library there is a certain tag.
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
						&lt;vcf-use-libAGG&gt;
						</listitem>

						<listitem>

			<section><title>MacOSX</title>
				<para>
				The VCF currently requires OSX 10.2 or better, preferably 10.3. 
				There are projects supplied for XCode. The Project Builder projects
				have been disconrtinued and are currently not supported as PB has 
				been dropped by Apple, and will not run on newer versions of OS X 
				later than 10.2. You can download the VCF from SourceForge via cvs 
				(see the instructions getting the VCF via CVS). 
				</para>
				<para>
				Once you have downloaded the code you need to make a few environment 
				configurations. Currently the projects depend on having the 
				environment	variables VCF_INCLUDE, VCF_BIN, and VCF_LIB defined. This 
				will go away in the near future but for now please define them. To 
				define environment variables in OSX create a ".MacOSX" directory under 
				you home directory. Create a file called "environment.plist" under the 
				.MacOSX directory like so:
				<programlisting>
cd ~
mkdir .MacOSX
touch .MacOSX/environment.plist
open .MacOSX/environment.plist
				</programlisting>
				This will open the environment.plist in the Property List Editor. Add 
				the variables VCF_INCLUDE, VCF_BIN, and VCF_LIB, with VCF_INCLUDE set 
				to "&lt;vcf root&gt;/include", VCF_BIN set to "&lt;vcf root&gt;/bin", 
				and VCF_LIB set to "&lt;vcf root&gt;/lib". You can see an example 
				below:
				<graphic fileref="gfx/mac-env-vars.png"> 
				</graphic>
				You may have to logout and log back in to get the environment variables 
				to take effect.
				</para>
				<para>
				Now you should be ready to open the VCF in XCode or Project Builder. For 
				Xcode open the vcf/build/xcode/vcfAllProjects.pbproj project. For Project
				Builder open the vcf/build/osx-pb/vcfAllProjects.pbproj project. There are
				"release" and "debug" targets provided. This was done because we had 
				problems understanding how to work with the whole development/deployment 
				builds. In the future this will almost certainly change.
				</para>
				<para>
				Each of the "kits" of the VCF are built as Frameworks under Mac OSX. Thus
				if you have an application you'd like to add VCF support to, you just need to
				add the appropriate VCF framework kit, such as FoundationKit.framework, 
				GraphicsKit.framework, or ApplicationKit.framework.
				</para>

			<section><title>Linux</title>
				<para>
				Currently the Linux port is in progress and these instructions may change,
				but here are the current steps to build, as of November 3, 2003.
				</para>
				<para>For Linux systemsFor Linux systems
				First make sure you have GTK (at least version 2.2). Most recent linux 
				distributions include this by default, so you probably have it. An easy 
				test would be to try the following:
	<programlisting>
echo `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags`
	</programlisting>
				You should see some sort of GCC compiler flags - if you get back error messages 
				like:
	<programlisting>
pkg-config: command not found
	</programlisting>
				Then you don't have the pkg-config system installed (and almost certainly not 
				GTK which depends on pkg-config). If you see something like:
	<programlisting>
Package gtk+-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `gtk+-2.0.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'gtk+-2.0' found
	</programlisting>
				Then you have the pkg-config tool, but probably not gtk installed (or not 
				installed correctly).
				</para>
				<para>For more information about GTK and installing it go 
				<ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.2/gtk/gtk-building.html"> 
				here</ulink>.
				</para>
				<para>
				Once you have confirmed you have (or installed) GTK, go to the 
				vcf/build/make directory. Type 
				<programlisting>
make debug
				</programlisting>
				for a debug version of the libraries, or 
				<programlisting>
make release</programlisting>
				for an optimized, release version of the libraries. To build both release
				and debug targets, type:
				<programlisting>
make all</programlisting>
				</para>
				<para>
				The .a library files will be output to the vcf/lib directory, while the 
				.so shared libraries will be output to the vcf/bin directory. To ensure 
				programs can load these up you may need to add the vcf/bin path to your 
				LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In the future this may change to correctly using the -rpath
				option to ld when linking.
				</para>
				<para>
				There is currently no install target. This needs to be addressed in the 
				very near future! Presumably, you can just copy the .so's in the vcf/bin 
				directory into /usr/local/lib.

		<section><title>Library Support by Compiler</title>

				The libraries that constitute the VCF and support by various compilers 
				are given in the table below. The VCF is modular by nature, and some 
				parts of the framework are not supported by all compilers. The OSX and 
				Linux ports are in progress, and we welcome support from new developers 
				to help finish these ports (as well as on the Win32 side).

		<section><title>Registering at SF</title>
		<para>
		Interested in contributing to the VCF project ? Great ! First you need to become a 
		member of Source Forge. SourceForge membership is free, and only takes a minute to 
		fill out the web form. It is a requirement for participating in any 
		Source Forge sponsored project, like the VCF. You can join at the Source Forge 
			<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">New User page</ulink>.
		</para>
		<para>
		Next, you need to email me, and let me know to add you to the project. It usually 
		takes a day or so for your Source Forge account to become activated,  so keep that 
		in mind. If your a developer, you'll be added with read/write privileges to the CVS 
		source tree. 
		</para>
		</section>
		<section><title>Setting up CVS</title>
			<para>
			Once all of this is done, all you have to do is setup your machine to use CVS 
			and SSH. CVS and SSH are must have tools, without these you'll not be able to 
			check source code in or out from CVS, which is the standard version control 
			program used by all Source Forge projects. You can get both of these tools 
			from a variety of places, including the VCF Installer, as well as 
			a smaller installer on the project that only installs CVS and SSH, 
			and also configures your system to use them ( you can get this installer 
			here). For documentation on how to use SSH on your Win32 system, SourceForge 
			has some great articles, as well as some specific stuff just for Win32 
			(here, and here). There are some things you'll need to check for to make 
			sure CVS and SSH will work together correctly so please verify the following: 
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>
				You'll need a CVSROOT variable that equals 
				<synopsis>
:ext:&lt;your username&gt;@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vcf
				</synopsis>
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				You'll need a CVS_RSH that equals "ssh"

		<section><title>Developing in the main VCF source tree</title>
			<para>
			When developing in the VCF proper you need to be aware that there are
			at least two branches in CVS at any given time. There will be a dev 
			branch for adding new features etc. Until this new set of features is 
			tested and ready it will stay separate from the main branch, which should 
			contain relatively stable code. When you are working on implementing these 
			new features you should be working in this development branch, NOT the 
			main branch. The main branch is only for checking in bug fixes for reported 
			bugs on it. This allows people to download a stable branch, rather than 
			pulling something down that is in a continuous state of flux.
			</para>
			<para>
			As a developer you need to be aware of this and make sure that you 
			are checking out the correct version. Please see this for instructions 
			on how to access branches in CVS trees. For further help look at the 
			<ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs.html">cvshome.org</ulink> 
			pages for more detailed information on using cvs.
			</para>
			<para>
			The recommended procedure is the following:
			</para>
			<para>
			Create two directories, perhaps something like this:
			<screen>
&lt;rootdir&gt;
vcfcode/
	dev/
		vcf/
		    src/...
	stable/
		vcf/
		    src/...
			</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
			This gives you a stable release directory to work on for bug fixing, 
			and another directory to work on for new development code that may be 
			unstable or untested and is not yet ready to go into the main branch.
			</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section><title>Standards</title>
			<para>
			Please read the naming standards documentation before you start changing 
			all sorts of things. These standards must be followed for any code 
			that gets entered into the main VCF development tree. 
			</para>
			<para>
			To get familiar with things build the VCF if you haven't already done so, 
			and then check out some of the example code in the vcf/examples 
			directory.  
			</para>
			<para>
			If you're unsure where to go next, try taking a look at the 
			<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=6796&amp;atid=106796">bug list</ulink> 
			or <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=6796">tasks list</ulink> 
			at the project page. Also feel free to contact anyone on the project or
			stop by the project <ulink url="http://vcf.sourceforge.net/forums">forums</ulink>
			for more information.  
			</para>
		<section><title>Coding and Naming Standards</title>
			<para>
			The following <indexterm><primary>standards</primary></indexterm> are 
			setup here to attempt to increase the readability of the VCF source code.  
			Developers interested working on the framework proper, must adhere to 
			these guidelines. Any questions regarding this, please email me. 
			<note>
			Much of this is rehashed from naming standards used on other projects, so 
			there is nothing new here, and tries to use as much common sense as possible.  
			Folks who are familiar with Borland's Delphi, Sun's Java, or (gasp...) 
			Microsoft's .NET naming conventions will probably recognize a great deal here. 
			</note>
			</para>
			
			<para>
			Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> use Hungarian notation at all in any code that 
			is in the main VCF development tree. Code submitted like this will be removed
			or ignored (if submitted as a patch).
			</para>
			<formalpara><title>Capitalization Styles</title>					
			</formalpara>
			<para>
			There are two main capitalization schemes the VCF uses:
			</para>
			<formalpara><title>Camel casing:</title>
			</formalpara>
			<para>
			Capitalizes the first character of each word except the first word. For example:
			<programlisting>
fileStream
			</programlisting>
			</para>
			
			<formalpara><title>Pascal casing:</title>
			</formalpara>
			<para>
			Capitalizes the first character of each word. For example:
			<programlisting>
FileStream
			</programlisting>
			</para>

			<para>
			The rationale for this is to allow for automatic source level 
			documentation by processing all headers through doxygen. Document the 
			headers. Document your classes. More documentation is better that 
			no documentation. Be as clear and concise as possible in explaining 
			what something does. You can and should use html markup tags for further 
			clarity, for example the &lt;B&gt; tag to emphasize some point or word,
			or use the "\em" doxy tag for this. Also where applicable, feel free to put 
			a sample piece of code that illustrates proper usage. Use the &lt;PRE&gt; tags 
			for this. Note that you can 
			also use the doxygen <ulink url="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html#cmdcode">
			"\code"</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html#cmdendcode">
			"\endcode"</ulink> tags as well. 
			</para>
			<para>
			The preferred format for documenting a class is to use the doxygen command
			"\class" to specify the class name and it's proper include file, followed 
			by the first paragraph with <emphasis>no</emphasis> "\par" command. Successive
			paragraphs need to use the "\par" command. Doing so ensures that the doxygen
			properly picks up you first sentence for use in it's "brief" comments section
			for your class. For example:
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
/**
\class FooBar FooBar.h "vcf/FoundationKit/FooBar.h"
Initial paragraph explaining what this class does.
\par
Further paragraphs explaining what this does...
*/
class FooBar {
//rest of code omitted...
};
			]]></programlisting>
			The last part of the "\class" command specifies the directory path of the
			include file. If you are adding a new class to on the VCF kits, then the 
			proper format is "vcf/" plus the kit name, followed by the actual header
			file name. So if you added a new CalendarControl to the ApplicationKit,
			the path would be "vcf/ApplicationKit/CalendarControl.h".
			</para>
			<para>
			Do not pollute the code, particularly the headers, with tons of "//" 
			spacers a-la what Microsoft's Visual C++ generated code for classes does. 
			Keep it clean.
			</para>
			<para>
			For single line comments line comments you can use the "//" but it is 
			still prefered that you use the
			<programlisting>
/**
comment
*/
			</programlisting>
			style.
			</para>
			<para>
			Use the @param, @return, @author, and @version to further clarify what 
			paramaters/arguments and return values do, as well as the author and 
			version of the item in question.The @version should be the current cvs 
			version that you are working under. If you are not entirely sure what 
			these do, look them up in JavaDoc (which is where they are from). 
			</para>
			<para>
			Example:
			<programlisting>
/**
This is what the method does...
@param void* this parameter is for....
@param bool this parameter indicates....
@param String the name of.....
@return int the return value is...
@author Jim Bob Snake
@version 0.5.9
*/
int myCoolMethod( void* d, bool b, String s );					
			</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
			In addition to the javadoc style tags, since we use doxygen, you can also use the 
			doxygen <ulink url="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html">special tags</ulink>
			for further control of formatting. Not all of the header docs use these yet, but for 
			examples that do, see the following files:
			  <itemizedlist>
			    <listitem><para>
				vcf/src/vcf/FoundationKit/Locales.h
				</para></listitem>
			  
				<listitem><para>

			<formalpara><title>Code Blocks</title>
			</formalpara>
			<para>
			While I am sure this is mildly controversial, bordering on hysterical, or perhaps 
			even blasphemous, I am going to set down some rules for code blocks, i.e. the famed
			"{" and "}". For consistencies sake please use the following guidelines for code that
			is in the VCF core source tree (i.e. anything under the vcf/src/vcf directory). Example
			code is free to diverge from this (though I would encourage it usage there too).
			</para>
			<para>
			For function blocks do not write them on a single line, even for something as simple as 
			a get method that just returns a member variable. The problem is that, at least on
			Microsoft compilers/debuggers (and almost certainly GCC/GDB as well), it becomes really
			difficult to step through code, or examine the variable(s). Beleive it or not, not all of
			us are <ulink url="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/11/255800.aspx">
			assembly level debuggers</ulink>!.
			<programlisting>
//Unacceptable			
class Foo {
public:
	int val_;
	
	int foo() { return val_; }
};

//OK
class Foo {
public:
	int val_;
	
	int foo() { 
		return val_; 
	}
};
			</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
			For "if..then" blocks use the following:
			<programlisting>
if ( condition ) {
	//code
}
			</programlisting>
			Please don't use 
			<programlisting>
if ( condition ) 
	//single line of code

			</programlisting>
			Use the "{}" brackets even with the one line. Please avoid using the following constructs:
			<programlisting>
//BAD!
if ( condition ) {
	//code
} else {

}

//OK
if ( condition ) {
	//code
} 
else {

			<ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp">
			http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp
			</ulink>. Download it from <ulink url="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14188">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=14188</ulink>
			</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</formalpara>
			<para>			
			Currently certain files used to build the VCF DocBook documentation 
			require hard coded absolute paths to make sure that things work right. 
			To generate the documentation on your own system, you'll need to edit 
			a few files to make sure the paths are pointing to the right directories.   
			</para>
			<para>
			To start with edit vcf/docs/Makefile in your favourite editor. Make sure 
			the HTMLHELP_COMPILER variable points to the correct directory on your 
			machine. Keep the directories in quotes or make will barf. Make sure 
			XSL_DOCBOOK_DIR points to where you have your DocBook xsl stylesheets installed.
			</para>
			<para>
			Next edit vcf/docs/vcf.xsl. Make sure the line:
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
<xsl:import href="d:/code/docbook-xsl-1.68.1/htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl"/>
			]]>
			</programlisting>
			Points to the right doc book directory on your system where your DocBook 
			XSL Stylesheets are found. 
			</para>
			<para>			
			Once you've completed this, open a command line (if you are doing this 
			on a Win32 system you'll need cygwin for this) and cd to vcf/docs. Type: 
			<programlisting>
make coredocs_hh
			</programlisting>
			This should generate the VCF documentation for you in HTML Help chm 
			format (including all tutorials). Look for a file called 
			"VCFDocs.0.6.8.chm" (or whatever the current version is set at).
			</para>
			<formalpara><title>Editing the VCF DocBook Documentation</title>
			To edit the docs open and edit the various .xml files in the vcf/docs 
			directory in your favorite text	or xml editor. The main ones are :
			<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			corelib_applicationKit.xml - application Kit stuff
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			corelib_componentAuthoring.xml - component authoring
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			corelib_foundationKit.xml - FoundationKit docs
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			corelib_graphicsKit.xml - graphics kit docs
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			getting_started.xml - using the vcf and getting around the framework
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			general.xml - general vcf docs
			</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>			
			</formalpara>
			
			<formalpara><title>Generating Tutorials</title>
			To generate tutorials, open a command line, cd to vcf/docs and type 
			<programlisting>
make tutorials
			</programlisting>	
			This will generate separate "articles" in each tutorial directory 
			(with the top level directory being vcf/examples). 
			</formalpara>
			
			<formalpara><title>Editing and Adding Tutorials</title>
			To add a tutorial article you have to edit/create several files to 
			ensure that the tutorial documentation is added to the full VCF 
			DocBook documentation, and that seperate articles 
			can be created.
			</formalpara>
			<para>
			To start, edit vcf/docs/vcf_docbook.xml. At the top there are a number 
			of ENTITY declarations, each of which point to specific file that 
			contains further documentation. This is done to break the documentation 
			into smaller, more manageable sections. To add a tutorial, you'll need to 
			add a new entity for each tutorial. Let's say we had a tutorial for "FooBar", 
			we'd add an entity for your tutorial(after the last ENTITY), like so:
			<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<!ENTITY foobar SYSTEM "../examples/FooBar/FooBar.xml">
]]>
			</programlisting>
			Now edit the vcf/docs/tutorials.xml file. This is organized first by kit 
			(or library) and then by section for each tutorial. Find a section or 
			create a new one and insert your entity that you created earlier. For our 
			FooBar example we'll create a new one under the FoundationKit. Our 
			example would look like this:
			
			<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<section><title>FooBar</title>
	&foobar;
</section>
]]>		
			</programlisting>
			Note that the entity name is the same as you declared it in the 
			vcf/docs/vcf_docbook.xml file.
			</para>
			<para>
			Now you need to create the actual content itself. 
			You <emphasis>must</emphasis> follow this format or things will 
			break. cd to your examples directory
			<programlisting>
cd vcf/examples/FooBar
			</programlisting>
			Create two files named like so:
			<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			&lt;tutorial name-case sensitive&gt;.xml
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			&lt;tutorial name-case sensitive&gt;Article.xml
			</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			For our example we'd create FooBar.xml and FooBarArticle.xml. Edit the 
			FooBarArticle.xml file and add the following (this must go right at 
			the begining of the file):
			<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE  book  PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN"
                    "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd" [	
	<!ENTITY foobar SYSTEM "FooBar.xml">	
]>


<article>	
  &foobar;	
</article>

]]>
			</programlisting>
			This will allow your content in FooBar.xml to either be used in the 
			larger VCF DocBook documentation or allow it to be generated as a 
			standalone article, suitable for posting on websites such as 
			<ulink url="http://www.codeproject.com">CodeProject.com</ulink>.	
			</para>
			<para>
			Now add your actual documentation (following DocBook rules) to Foobar.xml.
			</para>
			<para>
			Finally, to be able to actually generate the tutorials in a standalone 
			manner, we need to make one more change to the vcf/docs/Makefile. Edit 
			vcf/docs/Makefile and add your tutorial to the TUTORIAL_ARTICLES variable. 
			For our example, we'd add:
			<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
TUTORIAL_ARTICLES = ../examples/HelloWorld/HelloWorldArticle.xml\
../examples/FooBar/FooBarArticle.xml
]]>
			</programlisting>
			Save the makefile and your're done! cd to vcf/docs and type
			<programlisting>			
make tutorials
			</programlisting>
			You should end up with a FooBarArticle.html in your tutorials directory.
			</para>

	<para>
	Bugs, bugs, bugs - the bane of every developer and project. Naturally the VCF

	</para>
	<para>
	Seriously bugs do exist in the VCF and should be reported to the

	</para>
	<para>
	As a general rule please submit the following information: 
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>
		Operating System (and service pack, patch, etc if known). Please indicate

		</para></listitem>
		
		<listitem><para>
		Please try and rate the bug (in your opinion). Is it cosmetic, does it affect
