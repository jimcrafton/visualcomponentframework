   Installing the VCF</H1>
  <h3>
   Win32</h3>
  <P>
   You can install the Visual Component Framework in several ways. The 
   simplest way is to download the VCFInstaller.XXX.exe that utilizes a self 
   extracting InstallShield installer, and automatically configures your 
   system for you (in terms of environment variables), as well as 
   copying the VCF files to the hard drive location of your choice. In 
   addition it can also install CVS and SSH to allow you to keep up to 
   date and even check in changes you make back into the CVS source tree (to
   check in changes you will have to join the VCF Project at Source Forge.</P>
  <P>
   You can also install it by simply downloading the one tgz file that 
   contains the latest source code, but then you'll have to build the 
   binaries yourself.</P>
  <P>
   You can also install it by connecting via CVS (either as a registered 
   Source Forge developer - the registration is free, or anonymously), 
   and obtaining the current CVS code base. This also requires you to 
   compile it yourself. For more on this, please see <A HREF="Installing_from_CVS.htm">Installing
    from CVS</A>.</P>
