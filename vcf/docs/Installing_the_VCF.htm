   Installing the VCF</H1>
  <H6>
   Win32</H6>
  <P>
   You can install the Visual Component Framework in several ways. The 
   simplest way is to download the VCFInstaller.exe that utilizes a self 
   extracting InstallShield installer, and automatically configures your 
   system for you (in terms of environment variables), as well as 
   copying the VCF files to the hard drive location of your choice. In 
   addition it can also install CVS and SSH to allow you to keep up to 
   date and even check in change you may make back into the CVS source tree.</P>
  <P>
   You can install it by simply downloading the one zip file that 
   contains the latest current build, but then you'll have to build the 
   binaries yourself.</P>
  <P>
   You can also install it by connecting via CVS (either as a registered 
   Source Forge developer - the registration is free, or anonymously), 
   and obtaining the current CVS codebase. This also requires you to 
   compile it yourself. For more on this, please see <A HREF="Installing_from_CVS.htm">Installing
    from CVS</A>.</P>
  <P>
   When installing please make sure you have the correct Xerces XML 
   library on you machine. If you do not have this code, the VCF 
   ApplicationKit will not currently build. You can hack the code to 
   make it work without the XML library, but you then have no way to 
   load and save Component's, and certain other features depend on this. 
   Please see the <A HREF="Build_Steps.htm">Build Steps for the VCF</A>, 
   and <A HREF="XML_and_the_VCF.htm">XML and the VCF</A>.</P>
