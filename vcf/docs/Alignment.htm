   Alignment</H1>
  <P>
   Alignment allows you to specify sizing behavior for a control. 
   Alignment takes into consideration the control's geometry as well as 
   the parents size, and the other controls surrounding the aligned 
   control. It does not offer the finer grain control that setting the 
   anchor value does, and is mutually exclusive with the anchor value, 
   that is setting the anchor value of a control will automatically set 
   the control's alignment to ALIGN_NONE, while changing the control's 
   alignment will automatically set the control's anchor value to ANCHOR_NONE.&nbsp;<BR>
