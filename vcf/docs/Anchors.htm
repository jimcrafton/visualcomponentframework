   Anchors</H1>
  <P>Anchors allow you to customize the sizing behavior of a particular control.
  Setting the alignment may be done at any time after the control has been
  instantiated. By anchoring a control you can have finer control over how the
  control gets resized when it's parent is resized than simply specifying an
  alignment value. However, changing the anchor value of a control will
  automatically set the control's alignment to ALIGN_NONE, while changing the
  control's alignment will automatically set the control's anchor value to
  ANCHOR_NONE. The two values are mutually exclusive, you can get one or the
  other, but not both.
