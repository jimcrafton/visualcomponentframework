   Installing from CVS</H1>
  <H3>
   Setup</H3>
  <P>
   To begin installing the VCF from source control you'll need access to 
   CVS, a popular open source version control system. You'll need to 
   install this on your system in order to connect to the CVS server 
   that is hosted by <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</A>, 
   so you can pull down the latest source code. You can find out more 
   about installing CVS and setting it up <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=766&amp;group_id=1">here</A>.</P>
  <H3>
   CVS and SSH</H3>
  <P>
   When using CVS with a SourceForge project, SSH is used to ensure a 
   secure connection. Because of this you'll need SSH on your system 
   too. Because both are needed, when installing the VCF, the best way 
   is to use the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6796">VCF
    Installer</A> which will automatically configure your system for 
   using CVS and SSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
