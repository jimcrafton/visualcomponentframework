   Installing from CVS</H1>
  <h3>
   Setup</h3>
  <p>To begin installing the VCF from source control you'll need access to CVS,
  a popular open source version control system. You'll need to install this on
  your system in order to connect to the CVS server that is hosted by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>,
  so you can pull down the latest source code. You can find out more about
  installing CVS and setting it up <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=766&amp;group_id=1">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>
   CVS and SSH</h3>
  <p>When using CVS with a SourceForge project, SSH is used to ensure a secure
  connection. Because of this you'll need SSH on your system too. Because both
  are needed, when installing the VCF, the best way is to use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6796">VCF
  Installer</a> which will automatically configure your system for using CVS and
  SSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
