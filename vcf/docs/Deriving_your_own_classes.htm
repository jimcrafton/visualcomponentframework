   Deriving your own classes</H1>
  <P>
   Most classes in the VCF can be safely derived from. Often you'll find 
   all you need is to derive from <code>VCF::Object</code>. If you think your class 
   will need to support the firing of events and the ability of allowing 
   other objects to respond to these events, then deriving from <code>VCF::ObjectWithEvents</code>
  may be more appropriate. In terms of size 
   difference, <code> VCF::Object</code> requires 8 bytes of memory, while <code> 
   VCF::ObjectWithEvents</code> weighs in at 48 bytes. There are a variety of 
   reasons for this, almost all relating to event handling. For more 
   information on this please see <A HREF="Events_In_the_VCF.htm">Events</A>.</P>
  <p>Classes that need to be visually displayed, such as controls, should derive
  from the appropriate control class. For creating custom controls from scratch
  a good starting point is the <code>VCF::CustomControl</code> class. For more
  information on creating new components or controls please see the <a href="What_to_derive_from.htm">Components</a>
  section.</p>
  <p>When creating custom event classes you will probably want to derive from
  the VCF::Event class. </p>
