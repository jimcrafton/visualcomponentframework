*more musical chairs with headers again, in yet another attempt to make

*Removed all teh template RTTI classes and put them all in one header
*called VCFRTTIImpl.h. This should help compile speeds a bit.

*that aren't really neccessary - I'd estimate that 50% of the current
*event classes are unneccessary and can be removed.
