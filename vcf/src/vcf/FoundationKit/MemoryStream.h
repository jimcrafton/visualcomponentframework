*merged in the devmain-0-6-5 branch to stable
*
*Revision 1.1.2.3  2004/06/06 07:05:32  marcelloptr
*changed macros, text reformatting, copyright sections
*
*Revision 1.1.2.2  2004/04/29 04:07:08  marcelloptr

*Revision 1.11  2003/12/18 05:15:59  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.10.4.1  2003/10/23 04:24:51  ddiego
*more musical chairs with headers again, in yet another attempt to make
*them more efficent to speed up compiles.
*Removed all teh template RTTI classes and put them all in one header
*called VCFRTTIImpl.h. This should help compile speeds a bit.
*The next step is to look at some of the event classes and remove ones
*that aren't really neccessary - I'd estimate that 50% of the current
*event classes are unneccessary and can be removed.
*
*Revision 1.10  2003/05/17 20:37:15  ddiego
*this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from

*switched all member variable that used the "m_"<name> prefix to
* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.9  2002/02/28 01:07:09  ddiego
*fixed bug [ 523259 ] InputStream::read(String&) is incorrect
*added new virtual function Stream::getCurrentSeekPos to help fix the problem.
*Made apropriate changes to all stream headers and implementation to account

*added a cvs "log" comment to the top of all files in vcf/src and vcf/include
*to facilitate change tracking
