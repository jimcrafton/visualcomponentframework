*$Log$
*Revision 1.4  2006/04/07 02:35:36  ddiego
*initial checkin of merge from 0.6.9 dev branch.
*
*Revision 1.3.2.1  2005/11/28 21:01:06  ddiego
*added wait function to process class. added stubs for linux.
*
*Revision 1.3  2005/01/02 03:04:24  ddiego
*merged over some of the changes from the dev branch because they're important resoource loading bug fixes. Also fixes a few other bugs as well.
*
*Revision 1.2.4.1  2004/12/19 04:05:02  ddiego
*made modifications to methods that return a handle type. Introduced
*a new typedef for handles, that is a pointer, as opposed to a 32bit int,
*which was causing a problem for 64bit compiles.
*
*Revision 1.2  2004/08/07 02:49:16  ddiego
*merged in the devmain-0-6-5 branch to stable
*
*Revision 1.1.2.2  2004/04/29 04:07:14  marcelloptr

*Revision 1.10.2.1  2003/10/23 04:24:51  ddiego
*more musical chairs with headers again, in yet another attempt to make
*them more efficent to speed up compiles.
*Removed all teh template RTTI classes and put them all in one header
*called VCFRTTIImpl.h. This should help compile speeds a bit.
*The next step is to look at some of the event classes and remove ones
*that aren't really neccessary - I'd estimate that 50% of the current
*event classes are unneccessary and can be removed.
