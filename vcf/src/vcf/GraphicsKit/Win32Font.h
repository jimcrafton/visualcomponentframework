/**
*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.4  2005/01/02 03:04:26  ddiego
*merged over some of the changes from the dev branch because they're important resoource loading bug fixes. Also fixes a few other bugs as well.
*
*Revision 1.3.2.1  2004/12/19 04:05:05  ddiego
*made modifications to methods that return a handle type. Introduced
*a new typedef for handles, that is a pointer, as opposed to a 32bit int,
*which was causing a problem for 64bit compiles.
*
*Revision 1.3  2004/12/01 04:31:44  ddiego
*merged over devmain-0-6-6 code. Marcello did a kick ass job
*of fixing a nasty bug (1074768VCF application slows down modal dialogs.)
*that he found. Many, many thanks for this Marcello.
*
*Revision 1.2.2.1  2004/08/24 04:29:58  ddiego
*more printing work, still not yet integrated.
*
*Revision 1.2  2004/08/07 02:49:18  ddiego
*merged in the devmain-0-6-5 branch to stable
*
*Revision 1.1.2.3  2004/06/30 19:17:11  ddiego
*fixed some font issues. got rid of methods that are not implementable on other platforms
*
*Revision 1.1.2.2  2004/04/29 04:10:28  marcelloptr
*reformatting of source files: macros and csvlog and copyright sections
*
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/28 03:40:31  ddiego

*
*Revision 1.8.4.2  2003/09/06 19:45:45  ddiego
*changes to ensure that the destroy() is properly called.
*Destructors were moved back to pbulic scope in case that was causing a bug.
*Moving them all(all teh component derived classes) to private scope causes
*a complete failure in hte VC6 compiler. Alas...
*So destructors are present, and modal dialogs can still be created on the
*stack, but almost any other component should be created on the heap, and
*gotten rid of via free() NOT using operator delete directly.
*also moved the vcs info to the end of the file for some of the headers
*This will be an ongoing process.
*
*Revision 1.8.4.1  2003/09/05 21:03:39  ddiego
*moved the various control destructor's to protected scope
*migrated code into destroy() overridden methods
