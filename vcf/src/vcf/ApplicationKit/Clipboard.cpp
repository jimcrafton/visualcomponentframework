*added fixes for the following tasks:
*Task #82279 ApplicationKit: add static methods to singleton objects

*this required a bunch of changes in terms of getting rid of older style code
*
*Revision 1.4.2.2  2003/06/27 03:10:58  ddiego
*got rid of some redundant junk in the Clipboard and DataObject
*classes. Instead of a rather dippy use of the DataType calss, we now simply
*use pure mime-types to identify the various "flavours" of data.
*
*Revision 1.4.2.1  2003/05/25 19:07:15  ddiego
*fixed bug [ 524878 ] onDropped not called for MLTcontrol. This
*was due to errors in the drag-drop implementation for WIn32 and is
*now fixed.

*irrelevant files for COM support. The vcf/include/com and vcf/src/COM
*directories are now gotten rid of.
*
*Revision 1.4  2003/05/17 20:37:47  ddiego

* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.3  2003/02/26 04:30:54  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.
*most additions are in the area of the current linux port, but the major
*addition to this release is the addition of a Condition class (currently
*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.2.14.2  2003/02/24 05:42:19  ddiego
*moved the code for the VariantData calss into it's own header
*migrated to the new event style using Delegates instead of relying on
*the ugly macros that we were using before - same functionality though
*made sure everything still works and compiles, including neccessary
*changes in the VCF Builder so that it creates code in the new style
*This changes to teh new style of using Delegates completes task 58837
