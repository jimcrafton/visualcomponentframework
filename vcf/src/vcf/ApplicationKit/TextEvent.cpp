*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.3  2004/12/01 04:31:38  ddiego
*merged over devmain-0-6-6 code. Marcello did a kick ass job
*of fixing a nasty bug (1074768VCF application slows down modal dialogs.)
*that he found. Many, many thanks for this Marcello.
*
*Revision 1.2.2.1  2004/09/21 23:41:24  ddiego
*made some big changes to how the base list, tree, text, table, and tab models are laid out. They are not just plain interfaces. The actual
*concrete implementations of them now derive from BOTH Model and the specific
*tree, table, etc model interface.
*Also made some fixes to the way the text input is handled for a text control.
*We now process on a character by character basis and modify the model one
*character at a time. Previously we were just using brute force and setting
*the whole models text. This is more efficent, though its also more complex.
*

*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.

*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
