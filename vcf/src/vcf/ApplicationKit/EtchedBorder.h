*CVS Log info
*$Log$
*Revision 1.2  2004/08/07 02:49:08  ddiego
*merged in the devmain-0-6-5 branch to stable
*
*Revision 1.1.2.5  2004/07/15 04:27:14  ddiego
*more updates for edit nc client painting
*
*Revision 1.1.2.4  2004/07/14 21:54:41  ddiego
*attempts to fix problem with borders and drawing on common controls.
*Sort of works on editor control. There is a subtle repaint problem in painting
*damaged portions of the control.
*
*Revision 1.1.2.3  2004/06/06 07:05:30  marcelloptr
*changed macros, text reformatting, copyright sections
*
*Revision 1.1.2.2  2004/04/29 03:43:13  marcelloptr
*reformatting of source files: macros and csvlog and copyright sections
*
*Revision 1.1.2.1  2004/04/28 00:28:16  ddiego
*migration towards new directory structure
*
*Revision 1.5.4.1  2004/04/26 21:58:39  marcelloptr
*changes for dir reorganization: _VCF_MACRO_H__
*
*Revision 1.5  2003/12/18 05:15:58  ddiego
*merge from devmain-0-6-2 branch into the stable branch
*
*Revision 1.4.4.3  2003/09/21 04:15:35  ddiego
*moved the cvs info data to teh bottom of the header instead of the
*top so it is easier to get to the actual header class declarations
*instead of having to wade through all the cvs info stuff.
*
*Revision 1.4.4.2  2003/09/12 16:46:33  ddiego
*finished adding header changes to improve compile speed (at least
*with MS VC++) and to get rid of some of the clutter that the RTTI macros
*add.
*But Where'd the RTTI info go!?!?
*Have no fear it's still there! It is now located in three .inl files, one
*for each kit. Each kit will consolidate it's RTTI decls in the following
*files:
*FoundationKit:
*  vcf/include/FoundationKitRTTI.inl
*GraphicsKit:
*  vcf/include/GraphicsKitRTTI.inl
*ApplicationKit:
*  vcf/include/ApplicationKitRTTI.inl
*
*Please alter these files as neeccessary to add/subtract/alter the various
*RTTI info. Each kit is also responsible for registering any of the class
*in the ClassRegistry.
*A side effect of this is that I had to alter the memory allocation for the
*VC6 build for the Application it went from /Zm120 to /Zm150. I find this
*pretty lame but I don't know what else to do. Hopefully this will improve
*compile times when using the Appkit in other programs.
*
*Revision 1.4.4.1  2003/09/12 00:09:33  ddiego
*added better tabbing behaviour - fixed an earlier bug.
*Code is easier to understand and it simplified the implementation
*a bit as well
*Moved around the RTTI definitions for various Appkit classes to a
*single inline and stripped them from the various class headers
*
*Revision 1.4  2003/05/17 20:37:09  ddiego
*this is the checkin for the 0.6.1 release - represents the merge over from
*the devmain-0-6-0 branch plus a few minor bug fixes
*
*Revision 1.3.2.2  2003/03/23 03:23:48  marcelloptr
*3 empty lines at the end of the files
*
*Revision 1.3.2.1  2003/03/12 03:10:21  ddiego
*switched all member variable that used the "m_"<name> prefix to
* <name>"_" suffix nameing standard.
*Also changed all vcf builder files to accomadate this.
*Changes were made to the Stream classes to NOT multiple inheritance and to
*be a little more correct. Changes include breaking the FileStream into two
*distinct classes, one for input and one for output.
*
*Revision 1.3  2003/02/26 04:30:39  ddiego
*merge of code in the devmain-0-5-9 branch into the current tree.
*most additions are in the area of the current linux port, but the major
*addition to this release is the addition of a Condition class (currently
*still under development) and the change over to using the Delegate class
*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.2.2.1  2002/12/27 23:04:37  marcelloptr
