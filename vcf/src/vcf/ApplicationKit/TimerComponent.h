*
*Revision 1.6.4.2  2003/09/21 04:15:34  ddiego
*moved the cvs info data to teh bottom of the header instead of the

*

*added better tabbing behaviour - fixed an earlier bug.
*Code is easier to understand and it simplified the implementation
*a bit as well

*single inline and stripped them from the various class headers

*exclusively from the older event handler macros.
*
*Revision 1.4.14.1  2003/02/24 05:42:18  ddiego
*moved the code for the VariantData calss into it's own header
*migrated to the new event style using Delegates instead of relying on
*the ugly macros that we were using before - same functionality though
*made sure everything still works and compiles, including neccessary
*changes in the VCF Builder so that it creates code in the new style
*This changes to teh new style of using Delegates completes task 58837
