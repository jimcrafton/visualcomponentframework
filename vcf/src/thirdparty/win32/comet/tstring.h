	/** \page comettstring Comet tstring type.
	 *   In order for comet projects to more easily support unicode via the
	 *   windows file "tchar.h", many comet classes support the type #comet::tstring which is 
	 *   a convenience typedef to basic_string.  Associated with
	 *   \link comet::tstring tstring \endlink are all or most of the other STL 
	 *   classes that have a \p char argument to the templates.
	 *
	 *   In addition to being used by comet, this is a generally useful series
	 *   of typedefs to be used when combining STL types with tchar.h compatible
	 *   projects.
	 *
	 *   There are two area to be particularly wary of with STL and tchar.h.
	 *
	 *   The first is that the filename argument for file streams are always
	 *   narrow char *.  I would suggest using a #comet::bstr_t which will
	 *   convert for you, especially in UNICODE (actually UCS2 little-endien) projects.
	 *
	 *   The second is that tstring support for multi-byte character strings is
	 *   very minimal. Embedded NULLs in the stream are not a problem for
	 *   copying around, however none of the parsing/searching/comparison
	 *   methods cope with multi-byte character sets.
	 * 
	 *   I believe that part of the reason for this is the platform specific
	 *   nature of multi-byte, and the internal support for a variety of
	 *   different MBCS implementations by Microsoft.
