<section><title>Copy And Paste and the VCF Clipboard</title>
	<para>
		The VCF allows you to make use of the clipboard services provided by the underlying
		OS and/or windowing system. This is done through 3 main objects that interact with
		each otehr during the copy and paste process. The first is the Clipboard itself,
		that serves as an interface to the underlying native clipboard. The Clipboard works 
		with data that is wrapped in a DataObject, which can hold multiple data types. 
		Finally, you stream data to and from a DataObject via concrete input or output streams.
	</para>
	<para>
	In our example we'll create a window with two buttons, and attach an event handler to each,
	one that will handle coppying the data to the clipboard, and another that will take 
	data from the clipboard and paste in into an edit control.
