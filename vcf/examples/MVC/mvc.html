<h2>Introduction</h2>
This will the first in a four part series of articles
that will explain how to use the built Model-View-Controller
features of the Visual Component Framework, and it's
DocumentManager classes that provide a high level set of 
funcionality similar to MFC's Doc/View classes. During the
course of the articles, we'll discuss the basic design
of MVC in the framework, how to make a simple MVC app with 
a Model and a very simple controller. I'll discuss how to 
build your UI using the VCF's Visual Form File format 
and how to hook up event handlers (or callbacks) in 
C++ code to the UI components defined in the layout file.
Then we'll walk through making a complete MVC based app
that starts with drawing simple shapes and ends with an
simple drawing app that can draw shapes, allows you to
open or save with different file formats, supports 
cut/copy/paste, undo and redo, drag and drop for both
files and shape objects that you select, and that can
be dropped on external applications, shell integration
and finally has support in the UI for updating the state
of various UI elements like menu items and toolbar buttons.
</p>
<h2>Intro to Model-View-Controller</h2>
<p>
Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a pattern that's been discussed
all over the place. It originated with the Smalltalk group
at Xerox PARC, run by Alan Kay, in the early 1970's. It's 
basically a design pattern whose goal is to cleanly separate 
the code that deals with application's data (or model) from 
it's user interface(or view) and the code that responds to 
the user's actions. There are are a variety of implementations
out there, some better than others, some easier to use,
some more difficult. Java's Swing framework is one example
of MVC (though some might argue that it's a bit overdone).
MFC also has a primitive sort of MVC though it's possible to
argue that it's not very well done. 
</p>
<p>
Typically the Model is designed to hold only data. You interact
with the model to chage it's data. The Model usually has
one or more Views, with each view being responsible for
display some or all of the Model's data. If the Model
is changed, then there should be some mechanism by which
Views are notified so they can update themselves. The 
Controller acts as a kind of "referee" between the model
and the View(s). For example, if the user were to click
on the view, then the Controller would decide how to 
interpret the action (the mouse click), and make any changes.
Perhaps if the program were a drawing program, the click
might result in adding a new shape. If this were the case,
then the Controller would need to tell the Model to 
add a new shape. This would result in a modification to the 
Model, which would in turn notify it's View(s) and 
the UI would be updated and redrawn.
</p>
<p>
Given a general overview let's take a look at how the VCF implements
the specifics of this. The VCF has two primary classes that 
define the Model and View. In addition there is the Control class 
that implements the View interface as well as allowing you to set 
a custom view. All of the various UI control classes, such as the 
TextControl, ListControl, TreeControl, and so on, use Models to 
store their data, so MVC is not just a throwaway in the framework, 
it's built in and heavily used.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Model Basics</h2>
<p>
The Model class is an abstract class that other more specific model 
classes derive from. It provides the basic implementation for 
managing and connecting views to the model. It also provides a 
general purpose notification system for anyone interested in changes 
to the model by using a specific delegate variable named ModelChanged. 
The Model's views are updated by the updateAllViews() function that
iterates through all the registered views of a model and calls the
updateView() function for each view. 
</p>
<p>
<i>ModelChanged delegate</i> <br>
<img src="vcfmvc/mvc-diagram2.png">
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The Model class itself does not store or define how data is stored. 
It does provide some basic methods to setting and/or retrieving data,
as well as determing if the model has any data at all, and a method 
to clear it, or empty it, of all data. 
</p>
<p>
You can access data generically using the Model's getValue() or 
getValueAsString() methods. These take an optional key that's a 
variant that can be used to help retrieve the specific value.
For example if you had a model that represented a bunch of text,
then your implementation of getValue might just ignore the 
key parameter and simply return all the text. If your model
was a list of some sort, then the key might be interpreted as an
index and you'd return the value at the specified index in the list.
These are not meant to be the only way to provide access to the model's
data, but rather an optional way that you provide in the case where
it's not possible to call a more specific method of a model derived
class.
</p>
<p>
Likewise it's possible to set data generically through the Model's
setValue() method. Like the getValue() method, this takes a variant
to store the data and an optional variant to specify the key. Again,
this is not considered as the only way to set data on a model, but 
rather an optional method.
</p>
<h2>Data Storage and Variants</h2>
<p>
If you look at the Model class methods getValue() and setValue(), and
if you look at some of the other model implementations like ListModel
or TreeModel, you'll see that the VariantData class is used to represent
a piece of data. This makes it easy to pass around a variety of different
data types transparently, but it does not mean that you have to implement
the model storage using a VariantData. For example, if you had a collection
of floating point values, you might decide to implement the ListModel
and store the data in an array of doubles using std::vector<double>.
</p>

<h2>Views</h2>
<p>
While the Model has a number of methods associated with it, the 
View class is relatively simple. It's main function is to render, or 
draw the model. This is done in the View's 	paintView() method
which gets called by the framework. A GraphicsContext is passed 
in and you can draw whatever you need to. 
</p>
<p>
The View also has a pointer to the Model it's associated with and 
a pointer to a Control intance that it's associated with. Beyond
that it's up to the application specific design of a particular view
to store anything else. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>Controls and Views</h2>
<p>
A Control derives from the View class as well as containing a pointer
to a view. This means that by default any control can be added to a 
Model. By default the Control's paintView() method is just going to 
call the code in the Control's paint() method. By allowing the control
the possibility of an external View, you can customize the display
of a Control without using inheritance. The default painting behavior
for a Control is to check to see if it's view instance is non NULL,
if it is then it calls the view instance's paintView() method, 
otherwise it does it's own internal painting. 
</p>

<h2>Where's the Controller?</h2>
<p>
So far I haven't mentioned a specific class for the Controller. That's
because there isn't one! The Controller tends to be extremely application
specific and there's not enough common elements to justify a class.
Some possible options are to use the existing Application class 
and put your Controller logic there, or create a brand new class
that becomes your Controller. The important thing is what the class
does and how it interacts with the Model and View that qualify it as 
a controller.
</p>
<h2>Before you get started</h2>
<p>
Before we get too far into this, please make sure that you've installed 
the latest version of the VCF (version 0-9-8 or better). And you may want 
to have a glance at some of the articles here on CP to get a feel for 
how things work. Some useful articles:

<li><a href="???">Events and Delegates</a>
</ul>

<h2>A Simple Example</h2>
<p>
For our first step, let's create a simple application that displays
the information in the ubiquitous Person class.
<br>
<img src="vcfmvc/sc1.png">
</p>
<p>
First lets create our model. We'll call it a Person and define like so:
<pre>
class Person : public Model {
public:
	virtual bool isEmpty() {
		return attributes.empty();
	}
protected:
	Dictionary attributes;
};
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This is obviously pretty bare. Instead of having separate fields for
each member variable, like a name, address, etc, we are going to be 
lazy and use the framework's Dictionary class, which is not much more 
than a wrapper around std::map<String,VariantData>, with a few utility 
methods thrown in for good measure. This let's us write something like:
<pre>
attributes["Age"] = 38;
attributes["Name"] = "Bob";
</pre>
When you implement your model class you need to implement the 
isEmpty() method, this allows the framework to tell if you model has
any data in it. In our case we just return whether or not the attributes 
member variable is empty().
</p>
<p>
Now lets add support for getting or setting data implementing the generic 
getValue() and setValue() methods:
<pre>
class Person : public Model {
public:
	virtual bool isEmpty() {
		return attributes.empty();
	}
	
	virtual VariantData getValue( const VariantData& key=VariantData::null() ) 	{
		String strKey = key;
		return attributes[ strKey ];
	}

	virtual void setValue( const VariantData& value, const VariantData& key=VariantData::null() )  {
		String strKey = key;
		attributes[ strKey ] = value;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}
protected:
	Dictionary attributes;
};
</pre>
Note our setValue() implementation. We declare a ModelEvent, pass in the 
event's source (the model), set it's event type to Model::MODEL_CHANGED, 
and then call the Model's changed() method. This does two things for us: 
it makes sure to invoke the ModelChanged delegate with the event instance, 
and it calls the Model's updateAllViews() method. It's a convenience 
method so you don't forget to do this yourself.
</p>
<p>
If we wanted to get really fancy we could add a specific delegate to our 
class for greater granularity, for example we could have a NameChanged 
delegate, but for now we're just going to keep things simple.
</p>
<p>
Obviously we don't want to have to remember what the various attribute keys
are, so lets add some methods to make it easy to get and set the various
attributes of the Person class.
<pre>
class Person : public Model {
public:
	virtual bool isEmpty() {
		return attributes.empty();
	}

	virtual VariantData getValue( const VariantData& key=VariantData::null() ) 	{
		String strKey = key;
		return attributes[ strKey ];
	}

	virtual void setValue( const VariantData& value, const VariantData& key=VariantData::null() )  {
		String strKey = key;
		attributes[ strKey ] = value;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	uint32 getAge() const {
		return attributes["Age"];
	}

	String getFirstName() const {
		return attributes["FirstName"];
	}

	String getLastName() const {
		return attributes["LastName"];
	}

	String getZIPCode() const {
		return attributes["ZIPCode"];
	}

	String getAddress() const {
		return attributes["Address"];
	}

	String getState() const {
		return attributes["State"];
	}

	String getCountry() const {
		return attributes["Country"];
	}

	String getPhoneNumber() const {
		return attributes["PhoneNumber"];
	}

	void setAge( const uint32& val ) {
		attributes["Age"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	void setFirstName( const String& val ) {
		attributes["FirstName"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	void setLastName( const String& val ) {
		attributes["LastName"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	void setZIPCode( const String& val ) {
		attributes["ZIPCode"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	void setAddress( const String& val ) {
		attributes["Address"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	void setState( const String& val ) {
		attributes["State"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	void setCountry( const String& val ) {
		attributes["Country"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

	void setPhoneNumber( const String& val ) {
		attributes["PhoneNumber"] = val;
		ModelEvent e( this, Model::MODEL_CHANGED );
		changed( &e );
	}

protected:
	Dictionary attributes;
};
</pre>

So we can now easily get and set values on the Person class. Note that
there's no real reason to use the Dictionary object to store the value
other laziness. It makes for smaller code when implementing the generic
getValue() and setValue() methods and isEmpty(), but it's not as efficient 
as using more traditional individual member variables for each attribute.
</p>
<p>
At this point we have a complete, if simplistic, Model implementation. 
</p>
<p>
Now that we've defined a model let's set up a user interface. We're going to 
build the UI's for all these examples using the VCF's Visual File Format (VFF), 
which is basically an extension of the format that Borland's Delphi has used 
for years. It's easy to parse, it's not XML, and, possibly more importantly, it's 
extremely easy to read and edit by hand. For a more complete definition
of it, see these links:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://software-windmills.blogspot.com/2007/05/visual-form-file-format.html">Visual Form File format</a>
<li><a href="http://software-windmills.blogspot.com/2008/05/working-with-delegates-in-visual-form.html">Working with Delegates</a>
</ul>
 
Basically the VCF loads up a VFF file for each UI class that it attempts to 
create using it's resource loading logic to load the data in memory. Resources
can be stored in a more traditional resource script (.RC) and compiled into the 
final executable, or they can exist as external files. For the purposes of these
articles, to make things easy, we'll use resources as external files. The actual 
file name must be the same as the class with the ".vff" extension on the end. 
Our window class is named "ModelDataWindow" so our file will be stored as 
"ModelDataWindow.vff" and it will be in the Resources/ directory, at the same
level where the executable is.
</p>
<p>
We'll start with the following to define our main window:
<pre>
object ModelDataWindow  : VCF::Window
	top = 200
	left = 200
	height = 110pt
	width = 240pt
	caption = 'ModelData Window'	

	minHeight = 110pt
	maxHeight = 110pt	
end
</pre>

A few points really quickly: 
<ul>
 <li> as you can see you define an object with a name (this becomes the name
 of the component), specify it's C++ class, and then write out the properties
that you want to define. 
 <li> the VFF allows you to specify coordinate values in 
pixels (the default), points, inches, or centimeters. Points, inches, and 
centimeters all use the screens current DPI to determine the actual pixel value. 
 <li> note the use of minHeight/maxHeight - by setting these values we can 
 constrain the size of the main window. Since we've set them to the same value
 we will not be able to change the height of the window. We will be able to 
 change the resize width.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We're going to have a simple UI that displays some values, in a tabular interface.
To make this easy, we're going to use a special container class that will 
do all the work of positioning the controls
<pre>
object ModelDataWindow  : VCF::Window
	//rest commented out
	object hlContainer : VCF::HorizontalLayoutContainer
		numberOfColumns = 2
		maxRowHeight = 35
		rowSpacerHeight = 10
		widths[0] = 80
		widths[1] = 80

		tweenWidths[0] = 10
	end

	object hlContainer2 : VCF::HorizontalLayoutContainer
		numberOfColumns = 2
		maxRowHeight = 35
		rowSpacerHeight = 10
		widths[0] = 80
		widths[1] = 80

		tweenWidths[0] = 10
	end
end
</pre>

This defines 2 containers that we can use and reference later on. Most of the
values just specify various dimensions of the container.
</p>
<p>
We'll split the UI in two : the left side will be editable, and the right side
will just show the current values, and will be updated whenever changes
are made to the model.
<pre>
object ModelDataWindow  : VCF::Window
	//rest commented out
	object hlContainer : VCF::HorizontalLayoutContainer
		//rest commented out
	end

	object hlContainer2 : VCF::HorizontalLayoutContainer
		//rest commented out
	end
	
	object pnl1 : VCF::Panel 
		border = null
		alignment = AlignLeft
		width = 120pt
		container = @hlContainer		
	end
	

	object pnl1 : VCF::Splitter 
		alignment = AlignLeft
	end

	object pnl2 : VCF::Panel 
		container = @hlContainer2
		border = null
		alignment = AlignClient
	end	
end
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now we have the basics of our UI laid out. Lets add the rest of the controls,
specifically the labels, text control, and button that we'll use. The labels 
will be for names of the Person attributes that we will display, some of the 
read only attribute values. The text control will hold the LastName attribute
which can be edited. The button will be used to increment the Person's age
by 1 year each time it's clicked.
<pre>
object ModelDataWindow  : VCF::Window
	//commented out
	object pnl1 : VCF::Panel 
		border = null
		alignment = AlignLeft
		width = 120pt
		container = @hlContainer

		object lbl1 : VCF::Label
			caption = 'First Name'		
		end

		object edt1 : VCF::Label
			
		end


		object lbl2 : VCF::Label
			caption = 'Last Name'		
		end

		object edt2 : VCF::TextControl
			
		end

		object lbl3 : VCF::Label
			caption = 'Age'		
		end

		object edt3 : VCF::TextControl
			readonly = true
			enabled = false			
		end



		object lbl4 : VCF::Label
			caption = 'Modify Age'		
		end

		object btn1 : VCF::CommandButton
			caption = 'Click Me'

			delegates
				ButtonClicked = [ModelDataApp@ModelDataApp::clickMe]
			end
		end
	end
	

	object pnl1 : VCF::Splitter 
		alignment = AlignLeft
	end

	object pnl2 : VCF::Panel 
		container = @hlContainer2
		border = null
		alignment = AlignClient

		object lbl1a : VCF::Label
			caption = 'First Name'		
		end

		object valLbl1 : VCF::Label
			
		end


		object lbl2a : VCF::Label
			caption = 'Last Name'		
		end

		object valLbl2 : VCF::Label
			
		end

		object lbl3a : VCF::Label
			caption = 'Age'		
		end

		object valLbl3 : VCF::Label
			
		end
	end	
end
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now that we have the basic UI defined, let's put some code in place to load
it up:
<pre>
class ModelDataWindow : public Window {
public:
	ModelDataWindow() {}
	virtual ~ModelDataWindow(){};
};

_class_rtti_(ModelDataWindow, "VCF::Window", "ModelDataWindow")
_class_rtti_end_


class ModelDataApp : public Application {
public:

	ModelDataApp( int argc, char** argv ) : Application(argc, argv) {
		addCallback( new ClassProcedure1&lt;Event*,ModelDataApp&gt;(this, &ModelDataApp::clickMe), "ModelDataApp::clickMe" );
	}

	virtual bool initRunningApplication(){
		bool result = Application::initRunningApplication();
		REGISTER_CLASSINFO_EXTERNAL(ModelDataWindow);
		Window* mainWindow = Frame::createWindow( classid(ModelDataWindow) );
		setMainWindow(mainWindow);
		mainWindow->show();
		
		return result;
	}

	void clickMe( Event* ) {
		//omitted
	}	

};
</pre>
The first thing to note is that we need to add support for the VCF's advanced 
reflection/RTTI features, and that's where the <code>_class_rtti_</code>, and 
<code>REGISTER_CLASSINFO_EXTERNAL</code> macros come into play. You need to 
define this so that the framework can load up your window class dynamically. 
This happens when the Frame::createWindow static function is called - it loads 
up a window, based on it's RTTI Class instance, and automatically loads up the 
corresponding VFF resource for you.
</p>
<p>
The next thing is that we add a callback to our application, in it's constructor. That way
it's ready to be used and when we load our window's VFF we can reference it 
as a callback to use to add to the buttons ButtonClicked delegate.
</p>
<p>
When we run it, we get something like this:<br>
<img src="vcfmvc/sc1a.png">
</p>
<p>
Obviously not very useful yet, as there's no data! Our plan here is to create 
the model, and set it's initial properties, in the ModelDataWindow VFF file. 
You don't have to do things, but for the purpose of this first step, it's an 
easy way to work with it. In order to be able to this, we need to add RTTI
support, just like we did with the main window, only we will also be adding 
support for the various properties that we want to expose. To do that we 
define something like this:
<pre>
_class_rtti_(Person, "VCF::Model", "Person")
_property_( uint32, "age", getAge, setAge, "" );
_property_( String, "firstName", getFirstName, setFirstName, "" );
_property_( String, "lastName", getLastName, setLastName, "" );
_property_( String, "zipCode", getZIPCode, setZIPCode, "" );
_property_( String, "address", getAddress, setAddress, "" );
_property_( String, "state", getState, setState, "" );
_property_( String, "country", getCountry, setCountry, "" );
_property_( String, "phoneNumber", getPhoneNumber, setPhoneNumber, "" );
_class_rtti_end_
</pre>
This means that we can reference the age (or any of the other properties that 
we have declared here) of the person in the VFF by using the property name 
"age". We register this in the application by adding the code:
<pre>
virtual bool initRunningApplication(){
	bool result = Application::initRunningApplication();
	REGISTER_CLASSINFO_EXTERNAL(ModelDataWindow);
	REGISTER_CLASSINFO_EXTERNAL(Person);
	//rest omitted
	
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now we can make some changes to our UI and do the following:
<ul>
 <li> we'll create a new Person object. This will be our Model.
 <li> we'll set the first name, last name, and age of our Person instance.  
 <li> we'll set the model property of some of our controls, and we'll 
 set the control's model key so that it knows how to retrieve data
 from the model using the Model::getValue() function. 
</ul> 
</p>
<p>
First let's create the Person object:
<pre>
object ModelDataWindow  : VCF::Window
	//rest omitted
	object joeBobSnake :  Person
		firstName = 'Joe Bob'
		lastName = 'Snake'
		age = 24
	end
	//rest omitted
end
</pre>

We've set it's attributes, using the firstName, lastName, and 
age properties.
</p>
<p>
Next let's modify our controls:
<pre>
object ModelDataWindow  : VCF::Window
	//rest omitted
	object joeBobSnake :  Person
		firstName = 'Joe Bob'
		lastName = 'Snake'
		age = 24
	end

	
	object pnl1 : VCF::Panel 
		//rest omitted

		object edt1 : VCF::Label
			model = @joeBobSnake
			modelKey = 'FirstName'
		end


		//rest omitted
		
		object edt2 : VCF::TextControl
			model = @joeBobSnake
			modelKey = 'LastName'
		end

		//rest omitted
		
		object edt3 : VCF::TextControl
			readonly = true
			enabled = false
			model = @joeBobSnake
			modelKey = 'Age'
		end
	end	
	//rest omitted
end
</pre>

Note the two properties that we set "model" and "modelKey". The model
property is pretty self explanatory, we're setting the model of 
the specific control. Remember that a Control instance is a View,
so this calls the setViewModel which in turn causes the view to 
be added to the Model. The use of the "@joeBobSnake" means that 
we're referring to the component instance named "joeBobSnake".
The "modelKey" property sets the key used when the call to 
Model::getValue() is made by the control. This is used by some
controls when they needs to display some data, for example by the
Label control when it needs to display it's caption. Note that
the key's being assigned are the same name that we used for accessing
our attributes in our Person class.
</p>
<p>
The first text control (edt2) will allow us to modify the last
name of the Person instance. When the control determines that
it's text is being changed, it tries to modify the model, using 
the model key that's been assigned to it. In our case, whatever 
text we type in will be be asigned to the Person model using
the Model::setValue with a key of "LastName".
</p>
<p>
Now, lets add some code to modify the person's age, and we'll be done!
<pre>
class ModelDataApp : public Application {
public:
	//rest omitted

	void clickMe( Event* ) {
		Person* person = (Person*)findComponent( "joeBobSnake", true );

		person->setAge( person->getAge() + 1 );
	}	

};
</pre>

Note that we already had defined a method for this earlier. This just 
retreives the component, and increments it's age attribute. What
we end up with is something like this:

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
At this point we've gone through the basics of creating a model class, 
creating a user interface, and linking the two together. Our "controller",
if you will, is both the text control, and the application class. The 
text control, which is also a view, takes care of converting key input 
and updating the model. This in turn updates any other views attached
to the model. The other controller is the application which gets notified
when a ui element is clicked on, and then modifies the model by incrementing
the age. Obviously this is a somewhat simplistic implementation so 
our next step will be to enhance this functionality.
