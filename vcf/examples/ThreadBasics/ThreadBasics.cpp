Creating a thread that deletes itself, and runs over a fixed

Creating a thread that delete's itself, but is stopped before
it finishes what it's doing - see example2()

Creating a thread that is does not automatically delete
itself  - see example3()

Derive a new class from Runnable and use a Thread to
run it - see example4().
