The VCF Application Wizard has created the following files for you:
	$$root$$.cpp
	$$root$$.dsp
	$$root$$.dsw

	$$root$$.cpp - this is you main program and contains a "Hello World" 
	app and main window.

	$$root$$.dsp has the correct settings for linking to the VCF FoundationKit,
	GraphicsKit, and ApplicationKit libraries.
