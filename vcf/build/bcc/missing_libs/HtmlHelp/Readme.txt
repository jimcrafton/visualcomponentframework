Custom implementation of HtmlHelp.lib. 

This implementation tries to mimic Microsoft version of HtmlHelp.lib. hhctrl.ocx is not being loaded until needed and location of activex is taken from registry.

Build:

Just execute supplied batch file and copy generated lib file to your <BCC folder>\lib\PSDK.
